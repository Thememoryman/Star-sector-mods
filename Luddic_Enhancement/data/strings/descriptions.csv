hermes_pather,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

The Hermes is a small, dependable cargo hauler often converted for transport duty among poor frontier worlds. Its crew and passenger facilities are charitably described as ""robust"" but it manages to get the job done with remarkable consistency despite the primitive maintenance facilities it frequents.

Factory-spec, the Hermes is armed only for ""active collision avoidance"", but its turret system is often upgraded to achieve nearly full albeit light point-defense coverage that can destroy the stray missile while escaping from active combat zones. This Luddic Pather modification, however, strips out most of the cargo and crew space and small weapon mounts in favour of a medium hound-scavanged ballistic hardpoint, along with overcharged engines to quickly leap in, strike, and leap out again. While usually manned by the desperate or the mad, some truly legendary Martyrs started their lives as a Hermes captain.",,,
venture_luddic_path,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

Tough, dependable and not overly expensive, Venture-class cruisers are usually constructed by private corporations for escort duty or by small non-aligned worlds for system defense.

The Venture-class ships are perhaps the most widely used civilian cruisers in the Sector. The blueprints for the Venture are widely available and can often be secured without too much trouble. 

When used by small corporations, the ship is usually the pride of the fleet and is used to underpin vital operations. Due to its ubiquity, the vessel also serves with quite a few pirate outfits, where it sometimes fills the role of command ship.",,,
phaeton_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

Typically a medium tanker is left a smoking ruin in the wake of the Luddic Path. Sometimes, however, the hulls are stolen away, and completely remade. Now it forms sa flexible, if fragile destroyer, able to attack at range with its missile armament, or demolish foes up close with its large ballistic.",,,
starliner_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

Originally a symbol of Man's folly in conquering the universe with forbidden technology, this ship has been completely remade into a ramshackle support vessel. Wide crew decks and promenades have been stripped out and replaced with weapons, fighter autofactories and marine boarding facilities. With an incredibly strong missile complement and a flight deck, this ship has an ample range of tactical flexibility - however it's lackluster hull integrity is an issue.",,,
le_prometheus3,SHIP,"The fanatical Pathers have discovered an ironic sense of justice in converting the tanker which carries what they call 'Infernium' - AM fuel - into a hulking implement of holy war. Unlike the Prometheus Mk II. occassionally seen in Luddic Path fleets, this derivative still has most of its pre-existing civilian infrastructure intact, all focused on the makeshift ship factory in the now cored-out main fuel tank. It is from this drydock that a ramshackle suicide ship laden with explosives can be flown out of to bring the Divine Retribution of the Light of Ludd to the servants of Moloch, granting salvation in complete annhiliation.",,,
lp_dram_missile,SHIP,"A stripped-back Dram hull filled with explosives, this improvised suicide vessel can cripple stations and fleet vessels if it can make contact. However, its ramshackle construction lacks structural stability and the vessel can be disabled by withering firepower.",,,
dram_lp_ied,SHIP,"A improvised explosive Dram, this stripped-back hull is filled with explosives and crewed by Martyrs, who are willing to sell their lives dearly for Ludd. On ignition of the 'Infernium', this suicide vessel can cripple stations and fleet vessels if it can make contact. However, its ramshackle construction lacks structural stability and the vessel can be disabled by withering firepower.

This oversized improvised explosive device a simple Dram loaded with fuel and precisely placed explosives, which on activation gradual begins to leak Infernium into surrounding space, before the explosives trigger and ignite the fuel. The resulting explosion is devastating against anything in range. Luckily, the crude nature of the ship prevents the explosion from being very large, and the ship itself is incredibly fragile, meaning it can be avoided either by keeping distance or shooting the vessel before it comes too close.",,,

fidem,SHIP,"While the Mora was a ubiquitous hull during the Expansion Era of the Domain of Man, the smaller Fidem saw significantly less interest. Based on similar principles, the Fidem was designed to be a rugged, hardy frigate that could fulfill a variety of roles. And for its size, it was able to achieve a vast array of functions, with a combination of flight deck, Accelerated Ammunition system and flexible missile mounts in a small, heavily armoured package. However, the hull was simply too expensive to maintain when compared with its smaller, cheaper and more specialised competition - the Shepherd. Consequently the vessel fell out of use for centuries until the Church of Galactic Redemption picked up the safely archaic design to lend fighter coverages to smaller patrols.",,,
fasces,SHIP,"The Fasces is an old vessel, designed to provide close missile support in front-line combat. The result was an awkward ship that was too large to be a destroyer, yet it's armament was too undersized for a cruiser. The craft itself was also disproportionally expensive to maintain, and combined with limited mobility the ship faded out of widespread usage when tactics began to switch towards the more mobilty-focused Expansion doctrine. The Church of Galactic Redemption has since picked up the technologically inferior design as a solid if expensive artillery vessel.",,,
sebastian,SHIP,"A venerable design, the Sebastian is an oversized cruiser carrier with focused forward-facing ballistic firepower. When combined with its fighter wings this ship can concentrate a lot of ordinance on a single foe, however the vessel is let down by poor mobilty and a strenuous logistics profile. These features rapidly buried the Sebastian as a combat ship as fleet ships became more mobile, but has been picked up by the Church of Galactic Redemption due to the lack of excessively advanced technology. The ship is now an effective  fleet anchor, able to strike at range with fighters while keeping enemies at bay with its firepower.",,,

#Light of Ludd,,,,,
le_dram_w,WEAPON,"The strongest weapon in the Sacred Arsenal against the agents of Moloch, the Divine Light of Ludd is a stripped-back Dram hull loaded with explosives. The lightness and fragility of the improvised ship, combined with the fact that it's loaded with bombs and fuel, means the ship is somewhat fragile. However, the ship-sized missile is fast, and if it makes it within range of its target it can bring annhilitic salvation to stations and capital ships, and even remove cruisers from the void.",,,

#Alexandretta,,,,,
hegemony_hera,CUSTOM,"A remnant of the Alexandretta Polity, this base was forciably acquired by the Hegemony during the invasion of the Pirate Lord Scarborough in the name of 'protecting the citizens of Alexandretta'. Although the Hegemony leadership has made several promises to vacate the facility and return it to the Alexandretta Polity in the wake of Scarborough's defeat on Cerberus, the station still remains in Hegemony hands, and increasingly it appears that this fact will not change in the future. Understandably, ownership of this station is a sore topic for most Alexandrettans.",,,
luddicchurch_cerebrus,CUSTOM,"The seat of the Alexandretta Polity, this planet was the site of the last battle against the Pirate Lord Scarborough many cycles ago. While the surface of Cerberus was nearly destroyed in the attack, the Alexandrettans were able to fight off the invading pirates. However, the cost of the attack was horrific. Encroaching Hegemony influence in the wake of the assault and the weakness of the now crippled Polity drove the Alexandrettans to turn to the Luddic Church for assistance. The planet is now a somewhat loyal bastion to the Luddic Church, if more out of necessity rather than genuine faith. The remnants of Cerberus' industry now fuels a limited ship building program sanctioned by the Church, further increasing the theological dubiousness of the planet.",,,
planet_artaxerxes,CUSTOM,"When Lord Scarborough initially invaded Alexandretta, the lush alpine planet of Artaxerxes was the first to face his terrible hunger. The meagre first-responding defence force was completely annhiliated, with the fractured remnants driven back to Cerbrus, and leaving the populace to the deprivations and horrors of Lord Scarborough. Luckily, the defiance of the populace was able to keep the pirate forces occupied even after grievous retributions by the pirates, enabling stronger defences to muster at Cerberus. Unfortunately the Alexandretta Polity could not liberate the beleaguered populace, hard-pressed as they were to defend themselves. They were forced to watch as Artaxerxes and its populace were burnt in retribution for its defiance, in what is arguably the first usage of starship fuel to achieve complete planetary destruction.",,,
