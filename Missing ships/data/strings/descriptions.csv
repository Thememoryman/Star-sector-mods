missp_atlasmkiii,SHIP,"This conversion of the Atlas is fit with a number of converted cargo holds from Colossus-class freighters stapled onto the main superstructure. Numerous pillaged forge-vats are mounted in these converted hangars and outfit with as many LPCs as possible, enabling the ship to act as a makeshift fleet carrier. To round out its deadly arsenal, the hull is dotted with a number of weapon mounts designed to protect the carrier after it has disgorged its swarm of strike craft.

While the Persean Sector’s opportunistic underworld can be accused of many things, suicidal is the one they most often reject. Limited access to proper designs and functioning shipbuilding force these Pirate elements to scrounge and salvage for anything that gives them some chance at success. Conversions of popular freighters into makeshift warships often does the job well enough for relatively low cost, but the success of such designs is more often measured in surviving crewmembers than in tonnage of plunder acquired.

The Atlas is a favorite target of Pirate Warlords not only for the potential for good loot, but also for conversion into the Mk. II Combat Galleon. However, a number of less-than-brave captains realized that the risks in utilizing a ship that essentially amounted to a magazine detonation wrapped in aluminum foil did not lend itself to particularly long nor successful careers. The versatility and safety presented by strike craft, however, offered the perfect solution to their woes, and thus they returned to their hidden shipyards to build a newer, deadlier form of warship between bouts of debauchery and inebriation.

Necessity, the ancients said, is the mother of invention. The Atlas Mk. III is a clear demonstration of this principle put into semi-functional practice, and the surprising capabilities of this haphazard conversion has made it the mortal enemy of all legitimate shipping in the Sector.

missp_albatross,SHIP,"Designed as a dedicated Fleet Carrier, the Albatross-class offers superior performance across the board to many of the warships currently operating in the Persean Sector. Mounting an impressive array of weapons while maintaining a massive fighter wing provides this ship with substantial force projection in the theater of operations.

The Albatross is the ‘Cruiser School’ response to the criticisms levied against the aging Legion-class battlecarriers. The sacrifice of heavy weapon mounts does hinder the ability of the carrier to effectively remain on the line of battle, but this is more than made up for the Carrier’s superior speed and cavernous hangar bay. When paired with faster warships to pin hostile vessels in place, the flood of strike craft launched by the Albatross can easily overwhelm even the thickest of point defense screens.

Building upon the lessons learned by the Drover-class light carriers, Orion Shipyards submitted this design as an alternative to the more specialized Astral-class of Tri-Tachyon in the competition to fulfill the ‘New Fleet Prerogatives' posed by the Domain Armada. Ultimately, this design was preferred by the ‘Big Gun’ school of admirals, who were unwilling to accept the loss of direct combat potential represented by the Astral’s design. The introduction of the Albatross to the Domain’s fleets was in its opening stages when the Collapse shuttered the Gate Network, stranding a number of these vessels in Persean Sector. Their service continues in the hands of the Domain’s numerous successor states, where they have met substantial success as both line combatants and as fleet command ships.

While the Albatross has not achieved the same fame that some other carriers in the sector possess, the class is still well-loved for its versatility and substantial firepower. The design is particularly well-suited to Sector patrol duty, as few Pirates can stand before a design that can simultaneously out-range, out-pace, and out-shoot many of their own vessels.
",,,
missp_staple,SHIP,"Favored for the sheer tactical flexibility offered by its superior weapon arcs, protection, and speed, the Staple can excel in any role it is assigned to, provided that escort craft are in place to cover for the few deficiencies in the design. The centerline-mounted heavy weapons allow the ships to serve not only as a premier broadsiding warship, but also as a secondary linebreaker. It is not an uncommon sight to see Staples charging headlong into enemy warfleets alongside the Onslaughts they were meant to replace.

As strategic doctrines in the Domain Armada shifted away from large capital ships toward more versatile cruisers in the years preceding the Collapse, Naval Strategists were confronted with the serious issue of obsolescence in their heavier warships. While the venerable Onslaught-class could still serve as a line-breaker and nigh-invincible juggernaut in direct engagements, the design limitations of its hull had become evident in the face of faster and technologically superior ships. Even the most staunch radicals among the ‘Cruiser School’ Admirals recognized the need for dedicated capital ships in their fleet compositions, however, and thus put out the call for designs to fulfill their demands, codified in the ‘New Fleet Prerogatives’.

The Staple-class was Altair Exotech’s entry for the category of dedicated warship, where it straddled the line between the speed of Orion Shipyard’s Conquest and the armor and weaponry of Tri-Tachyon’s Paragon. A well-rounded, adaptable, and cost-effective design, the Staple won the favor of both the ‘Big Gun’ and ‘Cruiser School’ Admirals, ultimately being selected to replace the aging Onslaught. Introduction of the Staple was well underway by the time of the Collapse, and the design remains a somewhat common sight in the Persean Sector’s larger navies where it continues to serve with distinction.",,,
missp_expedition,SHIP,"The Expedition is among the largest civilian craft currently in use in the Sector. A post-collapse design that prioritizes survivability and function over comfort and form, this mammoth of a starship often serves as the centerpiece to every kind of civilian concern, from colony fleets to larger salvage companies and everything in-between. The combination of numerous weapon mounts, integrated command and control systems, and heavy armor plating all give this ship the ability to hold its own against many opponents when necessary. In truth, it is more akin to a mobile starbase than it is to any starship, and is most often found at the very fringes of the Sector.

Domain-era colonization policies dictated that colony fleets would be escorted by substantial naval assets, both autonomous and manned, to ensure the security of such undertakings. Given the availability of such protection in the Pre-Collapse era, the colony ships of those days consisted of little more than cryo-trays, engines, and life support. The shuttering of the Gate Network, however, made such designs impractical to use and impossible to reproduce. Hegemonic Authorities recognized that if Humanity was to survive in the isolated Persean Sector, it would have to expand. Given the growing lack of escort ship availability during the AI Wars and numerous intervening incidents, it was determined that a new ship be produced primarily to move as many people as possible with the greatest protection available in a single design. The Expedition is a result of their endeavors.

Another design born more out of necessity than to fulfill any sort of doctrinal niche, this City-with-Engines is durable, built to last, and equipped with all manner of services from hospitals to training centers to micro-forges that enable thousands to call these ships home. Curiously, the use of these ships has resulted in a sort of tradition emerging among Hegemony Officers. Captains who pass the graves of such vessels will always stop and leave behind a personal memento in or as near to the wreck as possible. Whether to mourn the loss of life, to lament the dimming future of Humanity, or to rededicate themselves to guarding the remains of civilization, the sight of a destroyed Expedition can bring even the most cynical of Commanders to a reflective pause.",,,
missp_buffalomkiii,SHIP,"A major conversion of the standard Buffalo-class freighter hull, the Mk III sacrifices almost all of its cargo capacity in exchange for mounting twin Fighter Bays, equipped with military-grade Nanoforges and the support facilities necessary to maintain constant fighter patrol. This revision is a desperate attempt by civilian authorities to provide trade convoys with some level of protection against increasing pirate activity. While the effectiveness of such a haphazard escort carrier has yet to be substantially proven in direct combat, no freighter captain would pass up the opportunity to fly under fighter escort. ",,,
missp_nyx,SHIP,"The Nyx is a general destroyer-class design, meant primarily to act as the stone wall between a vulnerable convoy and the mass of pirates and other desperate elements in the Persean Sector that wish to prey on them. Very heavily armored for its weight, the design offers substantial broadside firepower and decent maneuverability in a fairly compact package, making it a cheap and versatile convoy escort craft. Some of the more desperate navies in the Sector have taken to adopting the Nyx as their primary light line warship. The true strength of the design is in its cheap cost and ease of construction – the most successful of Nyx flotilla tactics involve overwhelming enemy forces with sheer weight of numbers.

missp_flak_craft,SHIP,"One of the largest designs that a Fighter Nanoforge can accommodate, the family of Patrol Craft LPCs serve numerous specialized roles in various fleet doctrines. Corvette-sized but still retaining the speed and maneuverability of smaller bombers, these craft are often utilized in to great effect in both pitched battle and in convoy escort duty.

The Flak Craft is a dedicated fleet escort corvette, and is primarily deployed ahead of charging formations to intercept incoming missile ordinance and dissuade incursions by enemy fighters. Built around a center-mounted Flak Cannon, this craft is adept at keeping the surrounding space clear of enemy contacts.",,,
missp_gun_craft,SHIP,"One of the largest designs that a Fighter Nanoforge can accommodate, the family of Patrol Craft LPCs serve numerous specialized roles in various fleet doctrines. Corvette-sized but still retaining the speed and maneuverability of smaller bombers, these craft are often utilized in to great effect in both pitched battle and in convoy escort duty.

The Gun Craft serves primarily as a frigate-hunter. Armed with a Heavy Machine Gun, it is able to pin smaller line vessels in place and put pressure on shields while heavier craft move in for the killing blow. Additionally, this corvette is purpose-built to kill counterpart craft, mainly to eliminate the threats posed by its Flak and Torpedo variants.
",,,
missp_torpedo_craft,SHIP,"One of the largest designs that a Fighter Nanoforge can accommodate, the family of Patrol Craft LPCs serve numerous specialized roles in various fleet doctrines. Corvette-sized but still retaining the speed and maneuverability of smaller bombers, these craft are often utilized in to great effect in both pitched battle and in convoy escort duty.

The Torpedo Craft servers as an oversized bomber and is designed primarily to attack larger craft already made vulnerable by other means. Built around twin single-use Harpoon MRM tubes, this craft can deliver a devastating payload to even the most heavily armored vessels. Wise starship captains should prioritize eliminating these craft before all other fighters. ",,,
missp_patrol_craft,SHIP,"One of the largest designs that a Fighter Nanoforge can accommodate, the family of Patrol Craft LPCs serve numerous specialized roles in various fleet doctrines. Corvette-sized but still retaining the speed and maneuverability of smaller bombers, these craft are often utilized in to great effect in both pitched battle and in convoy escort duty.

The standard Patrol Craft can be seen as the baseline for corvettes in the Sector. Armed only with light-mount weaponry, this corvette can fulfill any role it is placed into, but not with the same effectiveness of its more specialized counterparts.
",,,
missp_broadswordmkii,SHIP,"An upgrade to the ubiquitous Broadsword, the Broadsword Mk2 further upgrades the crafts arsenal with a series of Swarmer SRMs for interception and anti-armor duty. While still likely to falter in dealing with capital sized threats, the upgrades prove sufficient for dealing with heavier fighters and frigates, while still making for an excellent bomber escort.",,,
missp_colossus_heg,SHIP,"This ship is on the Hegemony auxiliary list and as such its systems have been upgraded to military standard and a rigorous schedule of servicing enforced with the expectation that it can be pressed into military service during emergencies.

The Colossus is a sturdy and venerable hull well-suited to conditions in the post-Collapse Sector, albeit possessing primitive accommodations and limited defensive armament.",,,
missp_condor_heg,SHIP,"This ship is on the Hegemony auxiliary list and as such its systems have been upgraded to military standard and a rigorous schedule of servicing enforced with the expectation that it can be pressed into military service during emergencies.

The Condor-class sees heavy service in the Sector as this carrier-converted freighter is, for many independent polities, the easiest way to procure fighter capability for their organization. Even with limited flight deck space, the Condor gets the job done, relying on its tough armor, excellent bulkhead strength, and a respectable (for a light carrier) weapons package.

This light carrier design is derived from Tarsus-class freighters modified by desperate scavengers and pirates. The conversion process was once an involved and complex affair requiring space dock facilities, but nowadays any hull-capable forge that will accept a stock Tarsus spec will, with the addition of a custom modchip, get you something just as good.

Some in the Sector argue that even the Domain, with all their technological know-how, relied on similar conversions to make more efficient use of a merchant fleet during times of escalated hostilities on the voluminous galactic frontier. Others point out that it is unclear how ubiquitous this approach was - there could have been fleets of Condors roaming Domain space, but there is scarce hard evidence one way or the other. Such data was all lost in the Collapse.",,,
missp_mudskipper_heg,SHIP,"This ship is on the Hegemony auxiliary list and as such its systems have been upgraded to military standard and a rigorous schedule of servicing enforced with the expectation that it can be pressed into military service during emergencies.

Most commonly used as interplanetary ferry, the Mudskipper is indeed interstellar-capable. The ship has no built-in shield generator so must rely on its durable - for a civilian craft - armour to protect passengers and cargo. There is little hope for the Mudskipper in combat, but it is generally equipped with a rear-facing turret to foil attacks by the ever-popular Salamander missile.

The HGA-220 was first produced as the """"Pegasus""""-class but was soon anointed with the altogether more humble name """"Mudskipper"""". This tough little ship has been a mainstay in backwater civilian transport for centuries, and although not pretty, the rugged construction simplifies maintenance and generous bay doors allow for great versatility. To this point, the Mudskipper's image in the public mind was cemented by a somewhat unlikely holovid sequence featuring a Mudskipper transporting a herd of bovids to a picturesque arid-terraform.",,,
missp_mule_heg,SHIP,"This ship is on the Hegemony Auxiliary List and as such has been overhauled to comply with the Hegemony Auxiliary Requirements through a rigorous schedule of servicing and modifications, which has led to the already tough armor of the ship being reinforced further and its subsystems getting a substantial upgrade, however it's missile hardpoints were sacrificed to free up space for these upgrades.

The Mule-class is a tough nut to crack, which makes its designation as a combat freighter apt. Pirates will often bypass even a lone Mule and go off in search of easier prey.

Often its captains casually ferry cargo to and fro between the star systems of the Sector alone and comfortable in the knowledge that they could afford the best protection a freighter captain can hope to get, short of an escort, of course.",,,
missp_nagato,SHIP,"The near mythical Nagato super-dreadnought, a project conceived in the same era of the Deployment of the Domain's Exploratum Drones, was designed to be a naval anchor for military operations in a sector, and to be a mobile HQ for domain operations in foreign space.

The ships absolutely staggering armament, material and crew requirements made this ship not only expensive, but unfeasible leading into the implementation of lower-level AI subroutines in ship systems (courtesy of heavy Tri-Tachyon lobbying and investment), the Nagato still stands as a relic of the forgotten glory days of the Domain, and should one be resoureful, or just downright crazy enough to get one of these on their hands, they could very well decide the fate of the sector with its bristling armament, near-impenetrable armor plating, its surprisingly numerous fighter bays, and staggering mobility for a ship of its size.",,,
missp_nail,SHIP,"The most desperate option of fighter duty, the Nail is for all intents and purposes a stripped down Talon. With its Swarmer Missiles stripped, most targetting systems downgraded or straight up removed, the Nail is now not much more than a vulcan with an engine and a pilot thats out of his luck. The benefit of having such a minimalistic fighter is the addition of 2 extra fighters in a wing.",,,
missp_nebulamkii,SHIP,"This once harmless civilian transport has been converted into a makeshift pirate command centre, stripping basically all the passenger cabins for fleet Command and Control systems likely salvaged off a derelict Legion. As a result, this ship is rather effective to the surprise of many privateers, as its built-in Nav Relay and ECM systems lifts the burden off the shoulder of EWAR duty from less-dedicated combat ships. The ship also sports a decent armament upgrade as well, alongside a hastily-installed nanoforge for access to a fighter escort.

The voluminous but ungainly hull of the Huan-Gogel 430 """"Nebula"""" does little to enhance the romance of interstellar travel but it does ensure a respectable passenger and cargo capacity for a ship of its class. Indeed, the Nebula has slowly come to dominate mid-tier passenger service since the muted reception of its first line of production.

The Nebula is equipped with a forward-facing shield to enhance the safety of passengers and extend the hull plating's maintenance schedule. And the Sector being what it is, several ballistic turrets and anti-missile all-band flare launchers have been mounted at fortuitous locations to assure paying passengers that their well-being is a top priority of the operator.",,,
missp_starlinermkii,SHIP,"A once prestigious cruise liner, the Starliner MkII is a rather effective pirate conversion that turns the ship into a lethal instrument in pirate raids. Equipped with crude communications equipment, Electronic Warfare systems, and fleet coordination subsystems, as well as a rather hefty upgrade to the base starliners weapon package, and the shuttle bay converted into a fairly effective carrier bay, this converted battlecarrier supports its fleet with a variety of fleetwide improvements while also being a rather capable combat ship as well, making it an unexpected, yet effective tool in any pirate warlord's arsenal.

A passenger liner from a more civilized age, the Huan-Gogel 440 """"Starliner"""" was built to travel between the systems of the Domain in speed and comfort. The Starliner features private first-class cabins, two classes of food service, a zero-G theatre, and even a small landing/launch bay for exclusive use by executive-class passengers. (Being a civilian ship there are, of course, no facilities for fighter repair and rearmament).

The Starliner is equipped with a forward shield to ensure passenger safety and protect the hull from routine abrasion. Refitted for the current realities of the Sector, this ship class is routinely equipped with all-band anti-missile flare launchers as well as a number of gun turrets; this serves not only to evoke a sense of adventure, but discourage casual piracy while justifying a """"munitions surcharge"""" on each ticket sale.",,,
missp_venture_heg,SHIP,"A hegemony auxiliary refit of the rather common Venture-class Cruiser, the ship has been refitted from its humble roots as a surveying and exploration ship to a heavily armored fleet anchor. Its onboard mining drone compliment has been substituted out for a proper nanoforge, allowing it to also fill in as a battlecarrier in the most desperate of scenarios.

Tough, dependable and not overly expensive, Venture-class cruisers are usually constructed by private corporations for escort duty or by small non-aligned worlds for system defense.

The Venture-class ships are perhaps the most widely used civilian cruisers in the Sector. The blueprints for the Venture are widely available and can often be secured without too much trouble. 

When used by small corporations, the ship is usually the pride of the fleet and is used to underpin vital operations. Due to its ubiquity, the vessel also serves with quite a few pirate outfits, where it sometimes fills the role of command ship."",""Tough and dependable, the Venture is usually fitted with a good missile complement but lacks the sustained damage output needed to do well in prolonged engagements.

missp_pelagornis,SHIP,"Equipped with Nanoforges of the size and power to rival planet-based manufacturing, the Pelagornis-class Super-Carrier is essentially a fleet unto itself; the sheer number of strike craft it can deploy can easily overwhelm any target in a matter of moments. In addition, the ship is able to mount significant arrays of weapons that place its direct firepower in excess of even the Onslaught-class. A true worldbreaker given form, this ship is the crowning jewel of the Domain’s ambitions.

Among the tales told by the aging members of the spacefaring community, none were as fantastical as those surrounding the legendary Pelagornis. Regarded as little more than myth or the result of armchair-admiral debate, this design was never acknowledged as genuine or feasible by the Domain Armada.

The existence of this ship tells a very different story. While the Nagato was to be the future standard of the Domain’s frontline ships, the Pelagornis was secretly developed as the be-all and end-all of fleet command technology, capable of coordinating the entirety of the Armada from a single platform. The reason for such secrecy was due to the greatest weapon in its arsenal: within the massive CIC was the WarMind, an abominable fusion of two Alpha-level AIs and a still-living human brain. All ship systems were directly slaved to this central intelligence, which was necessary for the ship to even function. However, the WarMind’s human component was left in a state of utter agony as result of its integration, and in early trials, the intelligence proved to be ambitious, unreliable, antagonistic, and above all, imaginative. Ultimately, the Domain Admiral’s sense of morality and paranoia won out over any practical arguments, as the original Pelagornis and the WarMind were destroyed and never further developed.

Perhaps it is best that this technology remains lost. The Domain abandoned this design for a reason.",,,
missp_path_ragnarok,SHIP,"‘And so, God, upon seeing his children on the brink of obliteration, spoke one final Word with which to undo their hubris. The word became steel and made its dwelling among the stars. The faithful, illuminated by Ludd’s pyre, have seen this steel and rejoiced, for salvation shall fall from the heavens as a mighty Hammer, full of truth and love for all.’ – Canticles of Ludd, Chapter 73, Verse 112.

Alternatively known as the Cathedral of Galactic Redemption, the Holy Instrument of His Will and Word, and, most fittingly, the Hammer of Ludd, The Ragnarok is the final doom of technologist heretics.

A floating scrapheap held together by nanogoo and faith, this mobile battlestation brings unrivaled firepower to bear against all those who would forsake Ludd’s word. Hegemonic Analysis of the Ragnarok reveals that, despite its ramshackle appearance, this vessel is perfectly capable of going toe-to-toe with an entire battlegroup and emerging relatively unscathed. In addition, it has been proposed that the ship possesses advanced command and control technology used to direct the various Pather cells found throughout the sector.

While most every faction has placed significant bounties on the destruction or capture of this ship, the Persean League is most fervent in seeking the Ragnarok’s destruction for one simple reason: it is believed by League Admiralty that the Pather cells that destroyed Mairaath were based off of Ragnarok, which was sighted in-system only a few days prior to the doom of Mayasura.

Ponderous and menacing, the Dominator-class is one of the most widespread system defense cruisers in Hegemony space. 

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and a constant presence in home space around civilized worlds and outposts, the Dominator is perhaps most hated and feared by pirates and law-breaking corporate agents.

Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship. 

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons.

The Enforcer-class ships commonly serve in system or convoy defense roles. The design features good armor and multiple ballistic hardpoints, while shield performance is somewhat underwhelming. 

The blueprints of the ship call for many components similar to those found in the Onslaught-class battleships, suggesting that the designs were created during a similar period of military expansion in the Domain. The Enforcer-class features similar no-nonsense weapon system design choices, tough bulkheads, and is well regarded by its crews.

Tough to beat in a destroyer to destroyer fight, the Enforcer rarely takes part in larger battles due to the common view that its low speed makes it a liability. Nonetheless, Hegemony order of battle doctrines mandate an attached Enforcer squadron as a screen for Onslaught-class battleships.

Its crew and passenger facilities are charitably described as ""robust"" but it manages to get the job done with remarkable consistency despite the primitive maintenance facilities it frequents.

Factory-spec, the Hermes is armed only for ""active collision avoidance"", but its turret system is often upgraded to achieve nearly full albeit light point-defense coverage that can destroy the stray missile while escaping from active combat zones.

This tough little ship has been a mainstay in backwater civilian transport for centuries, and although not pretty, the rugged construction simplifies maintenance and generous bay doors allow for great versatility. To this point, the Mudskipper's image in the public mind was cemented by a somewhat unlikely holovid sequence featuring a Mudskipper transporting a herd of bovids to a picturesque arid-terraform.

This ship, among many others, is salvaged hull with most of its ""unnecessary"" systems, such as most of life support, removed, energy weapons stripped and where possible added hammer torpedoes fittings, is core of the Pather battle formations. 

The Mule-class is a tough nut to crack, which makes its designation as a combat freighter apt. Pirates will often bypass even a lone Mule and go off in search of easier prey.

Often its captains casually ferry cargo to and fro between the star systems of the Sector alone and comfortable in the knowledge that they could afford the best protection a freighter captain can hope to get, short of an escort, of course.",,,

The voluminous but ungainly hull of the Huan-Gogel 430 ""Nebula"" does little to enhance the romance of interstellar travel but it does ensure a respectable passenger and cargo capacity for a ship of its class. Indeed, the Nebula has slowly come to dominate mid-tier passenger service since the muted reception of its first line of production.

Pather modification consists of stripping its hangar and turning it into makeshift hammer torpedo bay.",,,

A passenger liner from a more civilized age, the Huan-Gogel 440 ""Starliner"" was built to travel between the systems of the Domain in speed and comfort. The Starliner features private first-class cabins, two classes of food service, a zero-G theatre, and even a small landing/launch bay for exclusive use by executive-class passengers. (Being a civilian ship there are, of course, no facilities for fighter repair and rearmament).

Pather ""upgrades"" feature hangar with 3 chip slots and civilian grade nanoforges. This makes Panther Starliner main Luddic Path carrier. Guard it well.",,,

Tarsus-class ships are well known as perhaps the most flexible and durable freighters in the Sector. 

The secret to their reliability is that they were intended by Domain designers as hazard duty ships, presumably to supply frontiers and those front line fleets send to quash the ever-present rumbling of insurrection on the far reaches of the Domain.

Almost unmatched among civilian ships in bulkhead structural density and armor rating, Tarsus-class freighters are entrusted with important hauls and usually travel in convoys, a further buttress to the safety they afford to their crew and cargo.

Minimal weapon mounts permit the ship to mount a nominal PD weapons package. Rarely, Tarsus-class ships are outfitted with combat oriented hull or armor boosting modifications, which make them more difficult to maintain.",,,

Tough, dependable and not overly expensive, Venture-class cruisers are usually constructed by private corporations for escort duty or by small non-aligned worlds for system defense.

The Venture-class ships are perhaps the most widely used civilian cruisers in the Sector. The blueprints for the Venture are widely available and can often be secured without too much trouble. 

When used by small corporations, the ship is usually the pride of the fleet and is used to underpin vital operations. Due to its ubiquity, the vessel also serves with quite a few pirate outfits, where it sometimes fills the role of command ship.",,,

A technologically advanced frigate with an efficient shield generator and an impressive weapons package that allows it to punch far above its weight. These same characteristics mean its frigate-grade power core struggles to keep up, making careful flux management a priority.
