Advanced Avionics,diableavionics_avionics,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.DiableAvionicsUpgrade," Diable Avionic designs feature custom avionics systems allowing for a much finer control of their ships. The reduction in parasite accelerations coupled with their proprietary Quantum Branch Prediction Computer allows those ships to optimize their thrust and their firing solutions the more time they spend in contact with the enemy.

Upon deployment the ships suffer a %s reduction of their weapons accuracy. But after each computation cycle of %s, the ships gain a significant boost in both weapon accuracy and engines performances.
