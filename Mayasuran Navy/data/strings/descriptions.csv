MSS_Brawlerhead,SHIP,"An experiment done by mad geniuses, it combines the the Brawler's hull with a Hammerhead's head. With a shield wall system and active flares, its used as a defensive variant of the Hammerhead.",,,
MSS_Nailer,SHIP,"Heavy, compact, deadly. These three words describe Mayasura's flagship frigate. While being decently armed, the extra armor makes it a struggle for the Nailer to react fast to its more lightweight contemporaries. However, not all is lost when the Nailer becomes surrounded; many Nailers have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat with their famed durability and outstanding mobility with their supply of infernium on board. With higher crew requirements than normal sized frigates, extra care is needed to keep such an expensive craft maintained.",,,
MSS_Kontos,SHIP,"Rumoured to be one of the rare Mayasurian ships, the UAC for this ship has been kept a Hegemony secret after their raid on Mayasura. The Kontos is a well armed combat carrier with a suite of PD drones and two fighter bays. A highly powerful and expensive ship for its size, compared to contemporaries like the Condor and Drover.",,,
MSS_Mokarran,SHIP,"A famed Mayasurian battlecruiser, the Mokarran's design was inspired by the successful Hammerhead-class destroyer. Often the spearpoint of Mayasurian fleets, the battlecruiser shines in an aggressive attack role, thanks to its front-focused firepower and solid profile. However, it falls short in broadside and rearward weaponry and as such is succeptible to being surrounded - even if its weight belies its nimbleness. To compensate, a Mokarran rarely flies without a heavy escort. The amidships fighter bays are also most often equipped with heavy attack craft capable of warding off potential flankers. These qualities have earned the Mokarran its place as a symbol of power and fortitude, a reputation well-earned by its history in the field against the might of the Hegemony.",,,
MSS_Mokarran_HVB,SHIP,"This is a famous modification of the Mokarran, eschewing its fighter bays for more missile firepower with enlarged hardpoints in front of the ship. It was made as a signature ship for one of the simulated combat tournaments and custom-made for its winner after long and laborious modification process. Its maiden voyage was a disaster, with ship being lost in void of space for years... until it was found, restored to its former glory. Now it's ready to fight and won't back down, no matter the odds.

MSS_Crow,SHIP,"The Crow is an elite fighter outfitted with an experimental small scale damper field. A product of Mayasuran design, the Crow has more than enough armor to beat through piddly point defense weapon arrays. A perfect escort to bombers, a pair of crows can become an amazingly efficient bomber leader and soak up all the damage with the durability to match!",,,
MSS_Sarissa,SHIP,"A proud and noble ship, the Sarissa is the vanguard of Mayasuran carrier groups. With innovative engineering, the iconic Eagle-class cruiser has been reimagined as a battlecarrier with powerful weaponry and fighters to match. It leaves most of the original design specifications untouched, and as such is still a hefty yet mobile cruiser with a good mix of armour, agility and gunplay. Perhaps a ""jack of all trades,"" it however lacks the full fighter complement of other dedicated carriers and rather is looked down upon by other factions as being ""master of none"". This fact is blissfully ignored by the Mayasuran navy, reassured by the Sarissa's still respectable service record. Many officers pray for the privilege of captaining such a versatile and potent vessel.",,,
MSS_vigilance_carrier,SHIP,"The Peltast is based on the Vigilance hull and was designed to fill the role of a lightweight support vessel in Mayasuran fleets. Satisfying the navy's desire for a focus on fightercraft, the conversion replaces the frigate's usual missile payload with a cramped but functional fighter bay. The resulting vessel relies heavily on its fighters and quickly falters if engaged directly. Prohibitive logistical demands restrict it mostly to defense forces rather than attack fleets, although it does still make an exceptional skirmish, reconnaissance or support ship.",,,
MSS_Tiburo,SHIP,"Among the most elite units of Mayasura's arsenal, the Tiburo-class Heavy Frigate is one of the largest frigates in the Sector. An apex predator of its weight class, it excels at engaging larger craft and can even pressure light cruisers into a retreat when deployed in number or properly supported.",,,
,,,,,
MSS_Pilgrim,SHIP,"While meek and a bit stubby, the Caravan is for the bold Captain that decides to smuggle Volturnian Lobsters for a living. When approached from a distance, the Caravan looks as defenseless as a Colossus, an easy bounty for any pirate. But it's usually the last thing a pirate sees before they approach closely and get targeted by the Caravan's wide arcing highly customizable gun turrets. Lastly, the Caravan comes equipped with an Influence Minelayer, filled with highly explosive charges.",,,
MSS_Tachi,SHIP,"The Tachi heavy interceptor drone is the cheapest fightercraft available to the Mayasuran fleet, but proves that low cost does not always imply poor quality. Slower than some interceptors, the Tachi boasts superior armour and firepower, and while it is often outnumbered due to the low wing size it is still renowned as one of the most efficient fighter-killers of the Mayasuran Navy - an endearment despised by Mayasuran Aces.",,,
MSS_Argentavis,SHIP,"A heavily armed and armored destroyer, the Argentavis is the biggest in its weight class. With plenty of armor for a midline ship and a dangerous companion, the Argentavis serves as Mayasura's anvil. ",,,
MSS_Winghead,SHIP,"One of Mayasura's elite cruisers, the Winghead sports a quad array of medium ballistic mounts and an infernium jets booster for the engine block. After seeing the vulnerability of the Mokarran to heat-seeking missiles, Mayasuran engineers overdesigned subsequent classes of ships with rear-facing point defense. This trait combined with the rear mounted medium turret give the Winghead unmatched survivability in the field.",,,
MSS_Mako,SHIP,"One of the few heavy bomber designs in the Sector, the Mako is a frigate sized bomber with the shield and firepower to match. A built in autoloader gives the Mako punch with its centerline ballistic mount. ",,,
MSS_Arjuna,SHIP,"A ship made from Mayasurian decadence, the Arjuna is a heavy battlecarrier with strong armament and multiple decks. As a rival to the Legion-class, the Arjuna can hold its own in the line of battle. The greatest feature unique to the Arjuna is its superheavy turret, mounting a triple-linked gauss cannon. ",,,
MSS_Nebulosa,SHIP,"The Nebulosa-class is a prime example of heavy broadside firepower; with an extreme amount of guns equaling to a couple frigates, nothing can compare to the hail of bullets it exudes. ",,,
MSS_vigilance_m,SHIP,"In addition to their homebrew designs, Mayasura has made crucial upgrades to its regular midline ships. This Vigilance sports an additional rear small mount along with an upgraded engine.

An excellent harasser and support frigate, the Vigilance-class has oversized (for its class) energy and missile mounts. While it shines in a fleet setting, it can be easily overwhelmed by large numbers of smaller threats.",,,
MSS_bomb_frigate,WEAPON,A standard bomb bay modified with launch rails for assisted bomb launches.,Strike,,
MSS_Gandiva,WEAPON,"The signature weapon of the Arjuna-class, the Gandiva is a triple-linked gauss cannon built into the Arjuna's centerline turret.",Close Support,,
MSS_Gandiva_Elite,WEAPON,"The signature weapon of the Arjuna-class, the Gandiva is a triple-linked gauss cannon built into the Arjuna's centerline turret.",Close Support,,
,,,,,
MSS_Shuttlepod,SHIP,"Fast and lightly armed, the Combat Shuttle is a conversion of the standard crew transport pod that almost all ships carry. The humble shuttlecraft has been repurposed as a makeshift interceptor, armed with a machine gun and powerful engines. ",,,
MSS_Owstoni,SHIP,"Sporting heavy ion weaponry, the Owstoni is a dangerous companion to its bigger cousin, the Zygaena. Designed as a phase conversion of the Tiburo, this Superfighter is extremely agile and tough for its size.",,,
MSS_Sipahi,SHIP,"Mayasura's premier strike craft, the Sipahi Fighter-Bomber is light and nimble while carrying a moderate payload of EMP bombs. A turreted autolaser provides both defence against interception as well as additional pressure on the craft's target.",,,
,,,,,
MSS_inferniuminjector,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Arguably one of the most dangerous ways to boost one's spacecraft, infernium is injected directly into the engine's core. However, frequent use can lead to pilot nausea and a degradation of the ship's drive systems.",Movement,Provides an extremely fast boost to top speed.,
MSS_damper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates an emergency energy field by redirecting power from the shield generator, this strengthens the armor for 5 seconds. Known as a 'Last Stand' ability, this can let a heavily battered ship bring victory from the jaws of defeat.",Defensive,Activates an energy field that diverts power from the shield generator.,
,,,,,
MSS_dronegunship,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Deploys the Akinci-class Drone Gunship. An extremely lethal companion to the teratorn, it serves as the Argentavis' fifth gun in battle.",Drones (midline),Deploys the Akinci-class drone armed with an assault chaingun.,
MSS_Akinci,SHIP,"The Akinci Gunship Drone is a powerful companion to the Teratorn it serves. With only three able to be fitted in the Argentavis' drone bay, replacements are limited until out of battle, where the miniature autofactory can slowly replace the gargantuan Akinci.",,,
MSS_bomb_KE,WEAPON,"The Kilij bomb bay is built directly into the Sipahi's underbelly. Carrying a modest payload of six electromagnetic pulse bombs, they're more than enough to disable any ship in one go.",Strike,,
MSS_Sagir,WEAPON,"The Sagir Autolaser is a homebrew fighter weapon made for the Sipahi's miniature turret. With a withering rate of fire, this gives the Sipahi its dual role as a Fighter-Bomber. ",Point Defense,,
MSS_Javanicus_A,SHIP,"This Javanicus is one of the older designs. A limited production run makes these rare to see.

The Javanicus is one of Mayasura's defensive battlecruisers. Sporting a heavy broadside and ballistic armament, the Javanicus can put astounding amounts of lead down the field at a moment's notice. With a highly advanced autofactory and refit bays located within the central deck, an extra large space is dedicated to the Perryi-class corvette.",,,
MSS_Perryi,SHIP,"Dedicated to being deployed only from stations, the Perryi-class is a mobile escort for Mayasura's system defense ships. Due to its size, one could fit it within a capital grade fighter bay, however no other ship can refit, manufacture and deploy the Perryi like the Javanicus.",,,
MSS_Hammerhead,SHIP,"A top of the line Hammerhead, the Mayasuran version of its prized destroyer features heavier armor and an additional turret in the rear for point defense.

A midline destroyer from the golden age of the Domain, the Hammerhead is respected for its staying power in battle as well as its ballistic capabilities.",,,
MSS_Ferox,SHIP,The Ferox is Mayasura's elite heavy bomber. Being fitted out with such a large and arcane weapon leaves the Ferox as one of the most expensive bombers in the Sector. ,,,
MSS_MiniPC,WEAPON,"This is a single shot version built into the Ferox-Class heavy bomber. Usually mounted on capital ships. Produces ruinous damage that cannot be withstood by most defenses - for long.

The plasma cannon is a large, arcane weapon which is difficult to manufacture and maintain. Those captains who can afford it are rewarded with one of the most devastating weapons platforms employed in the Sector.

Plasma cannons are related to graviton and phase beams, in that they use poorly-documented properties of brane physics to deliver their payloads. A plasma cannon shell is a microfusion bomb which uses gravitic and baryonic lens to focus its energy inward. The resulting explosion creates plasma which is contained by a temporary mini-universe anomaly, while magnetic drivers mounted on the forward pylons accelerate it toward the target. The containment field lasts only a couple seconds, which is usually long enough for the anomaly to reach a target. If the convex hull of the field is not breached by ordinary matter/energy delivering at least 9 kN, the higher brane will absorb the destructive plasma, and it will vanish from our dimension forever. ",Strike,,
MSS_Starliner2,SHIP,"In the process of militarising the Starliner, the Mayasuran Navy has not merely up-armoured and up-gunned the original frame. The majority of the accommodation decks have been replaced with additional reinforcement to withstand elevated combat stress levels, and much of the lower deck and pool apparatus has been removed to make room for the installation of the Orbital Howitzer. Every shot of this gargantuan weapon brings recoil that shakes the entire ship, often causing injuries to crew. All these changes result in a ship once desired for luxurious accommodation; now turned into a dangerous artillery vessel that brings crew comfort to the absolute minimum.

A passenger liner from a more civilized age, the Huan-Gogel 440 ""Starliner"" was built to travel between the systems of the Domain in speed and comfort. The Starliner features private first-class cabins, two classes of food service, a zero-G theatre, and even a small landing/launch bay for exclusive use by executive-class passengers. (Being a civilian ship there are, of course, no facilities for fighter repair and rearmament).

The Starliner is equipped with a forward shield to ensure passenger safety and protect the hull from routine abrasion. Refitted for the current realities of the Sector, this ship class is routinely equipped with all-band anti-missile flare launchers as well as a number of gun turrets; this serves not only to evoke a sense of adventure, but discourage casual piracy while justifying a ""munitions surcharge"" on each ticket sale.",,,
MSS_Starliner_Howitzer,WEAPON,"The Orbital Howitzer is an underslung beast of a cannon attached to the Starliner (M)s belly. Slow and unwieldy, only expert gunners have been able to use this gun for long range bombardment upon enemy ships.",,,
MSS_shuttlepod_4,SHIP_SYSTEM,Deploys several combat shuttles armed with light machine guns. The shuttles can be ordered to closely guard the ship or roam freely around it.,Drones (midline),Deploys several defensive combat shuttles armed with light machine guns.,
MSS_Joker,SHIP,"The Joker Artillery Drone is one of the heaviest drones available to Mayasura, its unique feature being the Joker module. The module works on a shuffled group of weapons, allowing for a randomized loadout each time. However, more devious captains could change their hand by recalling the Joker and sending it back into the fray. This technique would allow someone to use the entirety of their deck!",,,
MSS_jokerdrone,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Deploys the Joker-class Artillery Drone. Fitted out with the Joker module, this allows the Joker to have a randomized weapon each time.",,,
MSS_Javanicus_B,SHIP,"The Javanicus is one of Mayasura's defensive battlecruisers. Sporting a heavy broadside and ballistic armament, the Javanicus can put astounding amounts of lead down the field at a moment's notice. With a highly-advanced autofactory and refit bays located within the central deck, an extra large space is dedicated to the Perryi-class corvette.",,,
MSS_Lasher,SHIP,"An ubiqutious design, the Lasher-class is a fan favorite of many Mayasuran captains. So much so that an upgraded LPC exists to keep it in line with Mayasura's other riff-raff of frigates. With an upgraded system combining the Lasher's natural accelerated ammo feeder with some added maneuevering jets, the Speed Shredder gives it both firepower and swiftness.

A favorite of pirates and private armies due to the ubiquity of the blueprints and its non-demanding support profile, Lasher-class frigates pack a respectable amount of ballistic firepower.

Lasher captains are usually no-nonsense types who let their weapons do the talking, and pick through the debris of enemy ships as opposed to trying more diplomatic or covert means of getting the job done. More often than not, that job involves quickly and effectively striking at (or guarding) small or medium-sized trade convoys. The light fighter and frigate escorts usually found guarding such convoys are hardly a match for the hail of projectiles a Lasher can quickly unleash. If that does not get the job done, the Lasher has another nasty surprise in wait - two missile hardpoints, more often than not fitted with ""finisher"" types of missile, such as the Harpoon MRM.",,,
MSS_overdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates the Speed Shredder, boosting both speed and weapon refire rate on the current ship.",Offensive,Provides both speed and firerate.,
MSS_Sentinel,WEAPON,"A collection of smaller lasers mounted together on a rotating pod, with a built-in capacitor allowing extremely high burst damage vs fighters and missiles.

The Sentinel is a military grade PD system that is usually only deployed on capital ships due to its high production and flux costs. Can detect and destroy incoming strike weapons and enemy fighters that have penetrated the capital ship's defensive escort screen. 

A combination of an autonomous alpha AI core for targeting and eleven separate carbon dioxide lasers make this weapon exceptionally effective in point defense. A dedicated rotator power supply makes target tracking almost instantaneous. The prohibitive energy requirement usually means that the weapon is only activated for seconds at a time, but that is usually enough to deal with any PD threat.",Point Defense,,
MSS_big_arbalest,WEAPON,"A triple-linked assembly of Arbalest Autocannons, the cheap and simple Arbalest Battery allows a ship to pummel shielded targets with astounding reliability, and at a very low cost. The kinetic shells are especially effective versus enemy shields.

Heavier patrol craft at the time of the Collapse were mostly fitted with the Arbalest Mk I weapons platform; this likely explains why the Arbalest is claimed to be among the most scavenged ship weapon systems in the Sector. The primitive cooling system and a lack of an autoejector hamper rate of fire and reliability. 

The only redeeming feature is the ubiquity of blueprints for the arbalest round, which is effective at bringing down enemy shields. The effectiveness of the shells is poorly understood, and is suspected to lie in the unintended electromagnetic properties of the shell jackets.",Close Support,,
MSS_Sunder,SHIP,"An upgraded version, the Mayasuran Sunder is the envy of every faction. Featuring heavier armor and an improved generator, this highly lethal ship can fit even the heaviest of weapons like the Triple Beam Cannon.

A technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer from the late Domain era designed to provide additional firepower in fleet actions carried out by the stretched Domain Navy rather than serve on independent patrols. It has powerful shield emitters and energy weapons but is vulnerable to strike craft and flanking assault frigates.",,,
MSS_Stingray,SHIP,"Designed to replace the aging Kontos-class, the Stingray is a highly maneuverable carrier with a flurry of energy and missile mounts. With high speed and tons of firepower at its disposal, this fulfills the role of Mayasura's 2nd generation of destroyer carriers.",,,
MSS_Perryi_F,SHIP,"Dedicated to being deployed only from stations, the Perryi-class is a mobile escort for Mayasura's system defense ships. Due to its size, one could fit it within a capital grade fighter bay, however no other ship can refit, manufacture and deploy the Perryi like the Javanicus.

Due to the need for a small light attack ship, the Mayasurans designed the Perryi with strong armament, however due to its low capacity means being tethered to defense fleets. ",,,
MSS_tribeam,WEAPON,"An enormously powerful laser array, the Triple Beam Cannon combines three high-powered burst beams into a single mount. Boasting superior precision from the alternating emitters, it is especially effective at melting... Well, just about anything.",Assault,,
MSS_gorgon,WEAPON,"A rack of short range high yield guided missiles. Low cost combined with high damage make these a strong contender, however limited fuel gives it little endurance.

The Gorgon missile is a short range missile made for strike capabilities. Each rack has two easily suppliable missiles, making this an easy choice for low budget captains. With a devilish green glow hiding the potent charge inside the payload, this could be compared to torpedoes of the same caliber.",Strike,,
MSS_gorgon_single,WEAPON,"A single, short, high yield, guided missile. Low cost combined with high damage makes this a strong contender, however limited fuel gives it little endurance.

The Gorgon missile is a short range missile made for strike capabilities. With a devilish green glow hiding the potent charge inside the payload, this could be compared to torpedoes of the same caliber.

This mount features only a single missile.",Strike,,
MSS_Crossbow,SHIP,"A heavy bomber featuring twin Gorgon SRMs, the Crossbow could be compared to a fighter with its top notch thrusters, shielding and armor. Mounting Twin Sagir Autolasers, this gives the Crossbow a bite like no other, allowing it to size up even capital ships and do heavy damage!",,,
MSS_TwinSagir,WEAPON,"These Twin Sagir Autolasers are built into the hardpoints of the Crossbow Heavy Comber. With a withering rate of fire, this gives the Crossbow massive potential against capital ships",Assault,,

MSS_maneuveringjets,SHIP_SYSTEM,Dumps infernium into the ships engines to greatly improve the ship's maneuverability. Also provides a good boost to the ship's top speed.,Movement,Provides a brief boost to maneuverability and top speed.,
MSS_microburn,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Provides a brief engine boost, propelling the ship forward at an extreme velocity.",Movement,"Provides a brief engine boost, propelling the ship forward at an extreme velocity.",
MSS_rocketlauncher,WEAPON,"Fires a barrage of unguided rockets. Useful for dealing with enemy armor, or - due to having no flux cost - applying sustained pressure.

Features an upgraded high yield barrage of rockets. Rockets are unguided, with the extra space being taken up by a larger warhead and improved propulsion systems, as well as thicker armor. 

Performs well against larger targets due to the higher chance of striking with multiple rockets. A rocket attack is often used as a screen before a torpedo strike to reduce the effectiveness of Point Defense systems. ",Assault,,
MSS_Patriot,SHIP,"A great destroyer leader and highly balanced ship, the Patriot is an energy focused light cruiser with plentiful moblity. Designed to lead smaller Mayasuran destroyer groups, the Patriot can easily keep up with ships like the Hammerhead and Sunder while providing an anchor for the rest of the group to fall back upon.

Most of the firepower comes from the Patriots central turrets, with any weapon mounted being boosted by the powerful generator. That same generator is also responsible for giving the Patriot top notch shielding, making it able to hold the line of battle even in big fleet fights. Lastly, the generous turret arcs keep the ship safe from even the most deadly missile barrages and fighter groups.
",,,
MSS_Khopesh,SHIP,"The Mayasuran Khopesh is upgraded with bigger Obliterator rockets and another wingman to complete the trio. The Khopesh can deliver an accurate and devastating rocket barrage to its target. Safer and more reliable in dealing its damage than other bombers, it also doesn't boast quite the same damage potential.",,,
szsp_minelayer,WEAPON,"Built-in to the Caravan, the Influence Minelayer is a trump card meant to keep pirate frigates at an arms distance.",Area Denial,,
MSS_Pelican,SHIP,"The Mithuna is the last in the line of hybrid combat freighter and logistic boats. Although not as powerful as a regular battlecruiser, the Mithunas large modular guns provide the punch to hold off even the mightiest of pirate brigands under the fusilade of its firepower. Due to the high resolution sensors built-in to the front of the Mithuna, this ship is mostly used as the flagship for techmining convoys. With a huge hangar bay in the rear, the Mithuna is a fearsome opponent when provided with LPCs because of its ability to coordinate a targeting feed to its fighters.",,,
,,,,,
szpsp_minelayer_fighter,WEAPON,"A fighter version made for the Didymoi, this comes preloaded with two side facing launchers.",Area Denial,,
MSS_Didymoi,SHIP,"An average bomber design centered around its payload, the Didymoi comes equipped with two influence mines that can be launched around enemy shields.",,,
MSS_Gaffel,SHIP,"A design dating from before the Legion's conception, the Gaffel evolved from a prototype of a heavy, fighter-equipped combat cruiser. Highly uncommon in the Persean Sector, the Gaffel is immediately recognizeable as something of an enigma among low-tech carrier ships. It might appear menacing with its array of ballistic turrets, but the ship's flux grid would be underwhelming on a destroyer, and it rarely equips weaponry any more demanding than medium point defense systems. The Gaffel's real combat focus is on its fighters, and fielding four independent bays within its boxy hull, it can bring a devastating punch to a battle while staying well out of harm's way.

In early years of expansion into space, massive targeting computers could only be mounted on stationary stations. After unfortunate encounters with rebels shielding their station and gun batteries with megatons of asteroid dirt and dust, companies were contracted to deliver a carrier with significant strike capabilities and capable of self-defence. The Legion-class battlecarrier was in the works, but it was far from completion and a classified project at the time.

Knight Industries's prototype was the most promising and won the deal. Soon enough, Gaffel, at the time the heaviest carrier to be fielded and was put into production as a stopgap. Its many decks served well against any kind of space fortification and it was still able to scare away smaller ships. Its strike capabilities earned it the nickname of 'The Hive Queen', the carrier is notorious for dealing out hot, quick death to whichever target its captain deems worthy of receiving the payloads of its many underlings. Later on, The Legion was unveiled and Gaffel was dethroned, falling out of favor and slowly fading - which, however disadvantageous to KI, was still better than outright deprecation, which was the fate of many worse designs.

Technological advancement allowed the Gaffel to remove its unwieldy antenna array in the front, which was replaced by two missile hardpoints, giving it yet more bite. The Gaffel seen today has lost a lot of direct fire potential in its development, and in modern times its inefficient, overworked nanoforges demand constant maintenance - however, crafty engineers were able to jury-rig salvaged autofacs so that the Gaffel does not fall behind. The price, however, was one of the carrier's decks, as it was where the power plant required to keep newer models running was located. Despite this it still holds its own in a battle, relying on its low-tech armor plating for defence in close quarters. 
",,,
MSS_Manta,SHIP,"A highly mobile pursuit destroyer, the Mayasuran version is upgraded with advanced autofactories along with more efficient reactors. The standard burn drive has been replaced with a short duration infernium burn, providing an elite captain unparalleled mobility.

The overshadowed third wheel of the Hammerhead and Sunder rivalry, the slippery Manta is a midline destroyer that can leave most frigates eating its wake. The ship is comparable to its heavier cousins by its wide shield and middling logistical stats, but differs with its focus on lighter weaponry and a more powerful engine assembly. The Manta's gun mounts are undersized if versatile, but it has the ability to support a wing of fighter craft which amplify its combat potential tenfold. The fast destroyer is let down by relatively low integrity, and a tendency to outrun its own fighters when it activates its burn drive.",,,
MSS_Raseri,SHIP,"An early epoch battlecruiser design, the Raseri is known for its ghastly broadside firepower. A rare sight to be seen nowadays, many were lost fighting Mayasuran battlegroups due to the Raseri's lack of adequate point defense mounts. However, many will say that the Raseri can compete with even the strongest of Mayasuran battlecruisers like the Javanicus in a straight battle. Lastly, the Raseri has speed to chase down smaller targets with its supply of Nitro Burn canisters; for such a bulky ship to move fast is an amazing feat indeed.",,,
MSS_microburnLT,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Provides a brief engine boost, propelling the ship forward at an extreme velocity.",Movement,,
MSS_tpc_turret,WEAPON,"A bulky energy weapon from an early epoch, the Micro TPC is a group of miniature variants built onto the Raseris hull.

MSS_ionlanceSM,WEAPON,"More then just an Ion Beam writ-large, the Heavy Ion Lance is a well-tooled scalpel which has been directly integrated into the Scaramouche's hull. A formidable burst of light and searing energy, each burst delivers enough EMP to savage even hardened subsystems.

While modular weapons similar to the Ion Lance have been developed, they often strain flux systems heavily due to capacitor feedback issues and are quite costly to maintain. By allowing the Heavy Ion Lance to directly tap into its parent ship's reserves, it maintains a far more favorable energy and flux ratio. 

Astute captains will steer well clear of the Scaramouche's dual lances, as without heavy kinetic support they will quickly be crippled by cascade after cascade of violent beams.

mayasura,FACTION,"At one point in time, the Mayasura System was among the greatest polities of the Sector. It was once home to the Mayasurian terraforming cabal, an independent nation whose might rivaled the Hegemony, and acted as a roadblock in their expansion on the northern Core Worlds. Their capital of Mairaath was crowned with three massive space cities. Combined, they housed tens of millions of people and formed the keystone of the terraforming project which transformed Mairaath into a paradise world. Until the terrible day of October 22 of Cycle 82, when the Mayasurians were laid low.

A fanatical sect of the Luddic Path pledged itself to destroy this great false idol. They organized a decades-long operation of subtle infiltration and sabotage, and on the chosen day, the Path assaulted the three Astropoli that orbited Mairaath, culminating in one of them crashing into the planet and utterly devastating it. Shortly after the terrorist attack, a Hegemony task force led by Commodore Jensulte attacked the Mayasurian fleet and engaged its flagship, the Conquest-class MSS Garuda with the hope of destroying it in orbit over their dying world. Though the Hegemony was eventually repulsed, Mayasura's navy suffered extensive losses as they were dealt their second major blow right after the first.

While the survivors were offered membership in the Persean League that was formed shortly after in response to the debacle, Mayasura ultimately declined. They instead chose to remain fully independent and begin picking up the pieces of their broken home, in stark defiance of those who sought to have them erased.",,,

Designed as a heavy interdictor, the Zygaena can even pressure smaller, faster ships with its interdictor array. With armament even more powerful than the Doom-class, the Zygaena is one of the most dangerous ships in the Sector. 

It's rumoured that Mayasura employed the help of Tri-Tachyon scientists, but whether or not they did it willingly is unknown. If Mayasura held their position, could they have united the Sector?",,,
MSS_Moa,SHIP,"Hailing its lineage from the Javanicus, the Moa is a heavily gunned defensive support cruiser.

planet_jangala_mayasura,CUSTOM,"Mayasuran officials have declared with the taking of Jangala, the hated Hegemony has been weakened, its forces in full retreat from the planet as they recognize this is the death knell of their empire. This is the official statement. On the surface however, a contradicting message is relayed to planetary defense forces. On this beautiful poisonous planet, there is a threat beyond the violent megastorms, hostile fauna, and toxic flora. Returning League soldiers describe the threat as hollow-eyed terrorists, seemingly wearing no biofilters.",,"Each day there is the threat of terrorism, public events and buildings struck by unknown assailants, often crying out a scream of support for the Field Marshal, who is officially dead. While a large number of Mayasuran assets have been sent into the jungles of Jangala, many remain deeply entrenched in the terrain. When night falls however, men turn up missing. They are most usually discovered fighting alongside the Hegemony remnants, or be found surrounded by buzzing insects, nailed to the trees. To be sent to to the Jangala's garrison becomes a death sentence and a test of skill.",
planet_asharu_mayasura,CUSTOM,"A desert planet, product of an abortive terraforming project from before the Collapse. It is populated by those who remained after Asharu's takeover by the Mayasurans.",,"In better times Asharu was a model terraforming prospect: A solar shade lowered the surface temperature while ice launched from the moons of Barad left shining vapour trails to fall as rain from the skies. Alas the chaos of the Collapse halted the ice and suspected Luddic sabotage destroyed the shade. The Mayasurans has revitalized the terraforming project, and while progress with the reactivation of the terraforming platform remains slow, efforts resume on the ground level in creating a better place.",
planet_garnir_mayasura,CUSTOM,"The thick, icy crust of this world is fed by cryovolcanoes that dot the surface. These frozen wastes are scored by mass-driver gantries from a time when the volatile elements of this world were extracted on a massive scale to feed terraforming efforts elsewhere in-system. Now these same frozen wastes fund the operation in feeding the revived terraforming efforts of Mairaath once more.",,,
planet_mairaath_mayasura,CUSTOM,"Mairaath was devastated by a coordinated Luddic Path operation in cycle 82 which turned its awesome orbital station-cities into weapons thrown against the fantastically terraformed surface. What remains is a charred yet unbroken, the carefully nurtured weather patterns of the great Mayasuran terraforming cabal transformed into nightmarish storms that circle the globe, forever stirring the ashes of a murdered world. Not all hope is lost however, the Mayasurans still cling on awaiting for a prophecy in helping to reclaim their former glory.",,"Even after its apocalyptic ruin, the Mayasurans still clings to the surface of Mairaath, huddled in the broken shells of its great cities brought low, blasted by unending storms.

station_tse_enterprise_mayasura,CUSTOM,"A center of mercenary recruitment for the Mayasuran Navy and a commercial interface with unsavory elements. Mayasurans took over the station recently from Tri-Tachyon. Populated mostly by veterans, retired pirates, radicals, and refugees, it is rumored that cargo containers have their IDs wiped and re-tagged, but the Mayasurans has made sure to put an end to these rumors. The cocktail bar ""Level 25"" enjoys a reputation for having the best drinks in the local volume.",,,
mairaath_station2_mayasura,CUSTOM,"Formerly one of the three astropoli of Mairaath, this station was rammed by a Prometheus-class fuel carrier and torn from orbit on a trail of fusion fire and radioactive dust. It used to be a pirate haven until the Mayasuran had recently taken over power and now uses the astropoli as a watch post for hostile threats despite its alarmingly hot radiation scans that decrease sensor effectiveness.",,,

MSS_Scaramouche,SHIP,"A lethal design straight out of the Mayasurian Naval Bureau, the Scaramouche is an effective deterrent and interdiction vessel. 

Originally as an orbital bombardment vessel, the hull went through several redesigns until it fit the needs of the fleet. Now sporting a pair of Heavy Ion Lances permanently baked into the production chip, the excess reactor power was instead devoted to overcharging the engines to allow for brief bursts of extreme speed.

Astute captains will keep this ship on a tight leash in smaller engagements, lest their pilots pull too far from the fleet and kinetic support to survive.",,,

MSS_Loyalist,SHIP,"Designed as an ideal lead ship for frigate groups, the Loyalist is an aggressively armed frigate that can play as both a command vessel and a withering assault ship. While massing as much as a destroyer, its lack of heavy mounts and lighter armor keep it tentatively in the frigate category. Mayasurian doctrine places the Loyalist in a similar position to the much larger Patriot, both often hosting the more eccentric commanders of their navy. 

Captains who pilot these vessels are known for being either irredeemable hotheads or cold, calculated strategists. Either way, the ability to actively drop component safeties and redline systems on a dime is highly valued by captains, and the extra strain on internals is considered a worthy sacrifice. Mechanics, on the other hand, loathe the overrides. Many battles that were won through heroics were then lost after a thorough berating of the officers by flummoxed maintenance crews. ",,,
MSS_National,SHIP,"Slinging both an impressive battery of three large energy turrets and a reactive overrides system, the National-class is considered the peak of aggressive flagship design for the Mayasurian navy. Coming from a similar design mindset to the popular Patriot and Loyalist lines, the National continues their signature active approach to space command. The lack of maneuverability compared its smaller brethren leaves it far more vulnerable to ambushes and flanks though, however with a flip of a switch the National is able to overdrive itself at a rapid cost to its deployment time. 

Early public documents list several iterations of a prototype which was developed as an artillery piece, but concerns about the hull being able to withstand constant use of all three turrets saw a complete gutting of the project. The success of the Patriot inspired a shipwright to produce a fresh redesign, which was readily approved and tweaked to current standards before being laid down.",,,

MSS_Gyrfalcon,SHIP,"The Gyrfalcon is a thorough retooling of the ever-beloved Falcon-class Cruiser, swapping forward firepower and its slim frame to instead make it a highly capable broadsider. The expanded missile handling capabilities further enhance Mayasuran doctrine, helping to round out their pickings for combat-capable cruisers. 

After the Battle for Mairaath, the Admiralty decided to refit and upgrade many existing hulls in order to cover the largest shortcomings of their prior fleets. While the original Falcon is ideal for long-range gunlines and harassment, it falters due to its lack of missiles and vulnerability to being surrounded. By concentrating its firepower in the sides rather then the front and giving it the flux grid to keep up, shipwrights figured that it would make being outnumbered an almost tantalizing prospect. 

In practice however, few captains possess the coordination to properly manage a dual assault, so it finds more use as a broadside gunship. Gunnery officers adore the wide firing arcs, mechanics loathe the repairs to armor that result from a side-on attack.",,,

MSS_Skyrend_Elite,SHIP,"One of the rarest Battlecruisers in the sector, the Mayasurans collaborated with Red Monarch Starworks to create a faster and highly lethal assassin. Sporting baked in infernium boosters and twin missile mounts, this variant oozes with its full forward firepower.

The Skybreak-class battlecruiser is a technologically-advanced warship investing heavily in frontal firepower. Inspired by the Sunder-class destroyer, the Skybreak was initially developed by Red Monarch Starworks as a cruiser, meant to shore up some of the weaknesses of the Sunder-class. As more and more weaknesses were ""solved"", the project's scope rapidly crept out of control, resulting in an expansive list of features which could only fit in a capital-scale hull. Overall, the project culminated in a surprisingly nimble, heavily armed, and powerful ship capable of delivering exceptional firepower against any who would oppose it.

However, these strengths would come with a cost. Maintaining the Skybreak's high speed within its size category would require reducing its armor to a relatively frail shell. The weapon overcharge system became mutually exclusive to more efficient and flexible shielding systems. Extensive and expensive automation had to be integrated in nearly every facet the ship's operation in order to offset the extended crew requirements of two hangar bays. Perhaps most damning of all, scope creep and compromise after compromise in the Skybreak's development would lead to the project budget being extended far beyond its limits. While the Skybreak-class has since proven itself, in its time the class's high unit cost and unproven status led to a limited inventory being adopted.

The few ships of this class which have made their way into the Persean sector have nonetheless performed admirably under pressure. Production of the hulls is still limited, but those few which circulate are coveted as truly fearsome battlecruisers.",,,
