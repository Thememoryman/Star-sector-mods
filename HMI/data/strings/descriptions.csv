sml_fragrifle,WEAPON,"Originally a sport's rifle from a by-gone era, the HK-101 Precision Rifle has been militarized into a superbly accurate, if somewhat underwhelming weapon. Useful for little more than rangefinding, shield worrying and, if the gunner is skilled enough, annoying enemy gun crews.",Fire Support,,
sml_shotgrun,WEAPON,"This medium-ranged shotgun is something of a frontiersmen favourite for hunting [REDACTED]. Has a poorer damage efficiency when compared with it's main rival, the dual autocannon.",Assault,,
retro_ml,WEAPON,"A low powered mining laser retrofitted for ballistic slots. Due to the ballistic integration, the weapon works by depleting manually loaded energy cores in short bursts. The process of reloading the cores is slow and sluggish, but the rapid depletion of the core provides a surprising amount of firepower. Lacks the ability to track missiles, but works as a semi-effective anti-fighter weapon.",Anti-Fighter,,
mcg_ml,WEAPON,"A mining laser that has been upgraded using an ingenous design from a legendary technician, this weapon is able to release a short range, high intensity beam that can score holes in light armour.",Assault,,
burst_ml,WEAPON,"By taking the basic mining laser and fitting increased efficiency capacitors, the assembly can hold and suddenly release greater power than normal. The Chimobuko configuration of this concept results in a better point defense weapon than the original Mining Laser while keeping it relatively easy to produce and integrate.",Point Defense,,
mining_gen,WEAPON,"This assembly, under mining conditions, fires a stream of magnetic nanites that seek out ores, which are then sucked back into the assembly. In combat the assembly is rotated 90 degrees to the side and overcharged. When released from the emergency vent port, the resulting blast of charged nanites can cripple ship systems and overload even mid-grade shielding. The intense conditions put tremendous strain on the assembly, ensuring the weapon can only be used once or twice before suffering a critical malfunction.",Strike, ,
kane_missile,WEAPON,"Considered to be an 'upgrade' of the Hammer torpedo, the Kane torpedo has very weak tracking capability while maintaining the same damage output as the Hammer. Mostly used by old dodgers with poor eyesight.",Strike,,
seth_sml,WEAPON,"A hacked drone construction assembler crudely applied to a missile slot, this weapon is able to release a slow but steady stream of Seth Drones; slow, dumb borer drones that burst apart into a small number of kinetic fragments when nearing enemy ships.",Fire Support,,
mbeke_sml,WEAPON,"A turret that shoots a steady stream of light rockets, the Mbeke Rocket Turret is considered to be an outdated if rather useful weapon to pressure enemy ships.",Suppression,,
rock_launcher,WEAPON,"The Lesser Xin Li Mining Collector uses localised gravitronic fields similar to artificial gravity on ships to grab small asteroids. While these fields are too weak to affect ships in combat, they can propel small pieces of scrap from inside the assembly at high speeds, although they rapidly disintegrate making them a short-range option. When combined with the asteroid acquisition hardware attached to the instrument, the assembly can work as a stop-gap point defense weapon. However, due to the fact that the assembly is not supposed to be used in the rapid acceleration of small objects, the damage output is frustratingly inconsistent.",Point Defense,,
,,,,,
hmi_ragtime,WEAPON,"The Ragtime Mortar is an attempt to improve upon the Heavy Mortar. With an extended barrel and a reinforced reloading mechanism, the Ragtime can fire slightly quicker and hit with marginally better consistency than the Heavy Mortar, but loses out on some flux efficiency.",Anti Armour,,
launcher_cannon,WEAPON,"The Greater Xin Li Mining Collector uses localised gravitronic fields similar to artificial gravity on ships to grab moderate asteroids. While these fields are too weak to affect ships in combat, they can propel objects from inside the assembly. The long gravity tensors of the instrument cannot fire miniature projectiles like its smaller brother, however they do allow the projection of large objects at moderate speeds over long ranges. This feature is used in combat to fire bundles of mining explosives at enemy ships. While the bundle is projected at a slow speed to prevent premature detonation and is easily defeated by shields, on contact with hull the explosion can be devastating.",Suppression,,
med_frag_mg,WEAPON,"Considered to be the older, more complex version of the Thumper. Deeply loved by Gunnery Officers for rewarding the proper upkeep of its overly complicated and many reduntant systems, liked by Starship Captains who like to take pot-shots at exposed enemy hulls, loathed by gunnery crews for using an archaic liquid cooling system that requires constant attention and continual upkeep.",Suppression,, 
clyde_mg,WEAPON,"Affectionately known as the Tommy Gun, this weapon fires a continuous stream of kinetic bullets at the enemy. Unfortunately let down by an old rechambering mechanism, which rapidly builds flux on use.",Assault,,
pumm_mg,WEAPON,"Techmined from some forgotten archaeological site, this oversized weapon is the spiritual ancestor of the vulcan cannon. Able to fire short bursts of oversized vulcan rounds at mid-range, this weapon is useful for anti-fighter and ship pressuring applications.",Point Defense,,
retro_mb,WEAPON,"A mining blaster retrofitted for a medium ballistic slot, this mining implement is deceptively powerful. While lacking the punch a mining blaster normally possesses due to a dependance on manually loaded energy cores, the better containment of the lower energy bolts results in a more flux-efficient weapon.",Assault,,
suowang_pulser,WEAPON,"A primitive variation of the Autopulse Laser, the Suo Wang Pulser shoots a rapid stream of IR laser bursts as long as its capacitors allow. Considered to be an effective assault weapon for light craft.",Strike,,
double_ir,WEAPON,"A relatively simple weapon, the Double IR Pulse Laser is exactly what it says on the tin - two IR pulse lasers combined into a single slot. The size of the doubled assembly requires the usage of a medium energy mounting, however it is still a useful and flux efficient weapon for assault craft.",Assault,,
seth_med,WEAPON,"Two hacked borer drone construction assemblys crudely applied to a missile slot, this weapon is able to release a slow but steady stream of Seth Drones with improved, longer range engines and implanted explosive devices. On close range, the drones burst apart and shoot the explosive charges at the enemy.",Fire Support,,
mbeke_med,WEAPON,"More a threat to friendly vessels than to enemy ships, this weapon releases a wide spread of light rockets. For this reason its use has all but disappeared, apart from several crazy miscreants from beyond the Outer Rim who still say its useful.",Suppression,,
rad_gun,WEAPON,"A horrifyingly inhuman machine, this weapon shoots a stream of concentrated high energy particles and subspacial anomalies in a brief beam that turns unprotected targets into molten, screaming goo. The saving grace of this weapon is it's absurdly high ordinance cost, meaning it's not in use everywhere - little hope for those facing it, however.",Suppression,,
mining_burst_blaster,WEAPON,"A modification of the Mining Blaster, this burst beam weapon has comparable damage output while also possessing an improved ability to land hits on enemy ships. Similar to the Mining Blaster, however, this weapon is very flux intensive.",Strike,,
,,,,,
dick_cannon,WEAPON,"A weapon extracted from what may have been a Pre-Domain weapons facility, this artillery assembly fires a considerable stream of fragmentary ordinance in a surprisingly flux efficient manner. While it has a short range and fires weak fragmentary projectiles similar to oversized vulan rounds, the high-speed turret motors and sheer volume of fire ensure it has a niche use as combination point defence and assault weapon.",Point Defense,,
mark_iv,WEAPON,"With shorter range and restricted by a shallow ammo pool and slower reload speed, this progenitor of the Mark IX is widely considered to be obsolete. However, with investment into range and magazine expansion, this weapon becomes an somewhat effective strike weapon.",Strike,,
tpc_hmi,WEAPON,"This halfway-successful attempt to replicate the Thermal Pulse Cannon in a modular form using Heavy Blaster components resulted in several key differences with the original weapon, with the ammo pool drastically reduced, accuracy compromised, range shortened and flux efficiency decreased. Despite these niggling factors making it closer to an oversize Heavy Blaster than an actual modular TPC, the weapon otherwise works as advertised.",Strike,,
hmi_heavy_assault_launcher,WEAPON,"The Baffler Area Denial Launcher is a simple weapon - it fires a large burst of unguided, low-yield bombs with basic proximity fuses across a conservative area. These bombs are large and slow moving, making them unique in that point defense weapons can target and detonate them. However, the launching mechanism is flux efficient and capable of projecting the bombs over long distances, although inaccruately.",Suppression,,
,,,,,
pumm_cannon,WEAPON,"A much larger version of the Pummerer Carbine, this monstrosity is too large to use as a modular weapon and only effectively useable in specially designed mountings, such as the spinal mount of the Junk. On the battlefield, this beast deletes fighters and frigates with ease, and worries larger targets enough to give them a second thought.",Fleet Defense,,
marlinblaster,WEAPON,"The core of the Marlin, the Scarlet Aura Energy Blaster lies somewhere between a Heavy Blaster and a Pulse Laser in damage output, with much greater flux efficiency.",General Purpose,,
tpc_weaver,WEAPON,"The vast majority of the Weaver is built around this improved version of the Thermal pulse Cannon. Possessing a greater damage output, faster projectile speed and better flux efficiency, the Weaver Pulse Cannon is nevertheless let down by its limited ammo pool.",Suppression,,
domres_hellbore,WEAPON,"Two Hellbores slaved into a single turret, this station-bourne weapon can crush Capital grade armour with ease. Luckily it's ungainly bulk prevents it from being mounted on anything other than a station-based platform.",Suppression,,
khradeh_left,WEAPON,"A weapon built directly into the sub-structure of the Jakkle, the Khradeh Autocannon is a mid-ranged ballistic gatling gun. While it lacks punch due to flaws sabotaged into the ship design, the alteration resulted in a reduction in expected flux cost, making it a very flux efficient weapon.",General Purpose,,
khradeh_right,WEAPON,"A weapon built directly into the sub-structure of the Jakkle, the Khradeh Autocannon is a mid-ranged ballistic gatling gun. While it lacks punch due to flaws sabotaged into the ship design, the alteration resulted in a reduction in expected flux cost, making it a very flux efficient weapon.",General Purpose,,
,,,,,
hmi_drill,WEAPON,"The Marx Drill is an effective instrument for the grinding, sorting and analysis of ore materials, ensuring its widespread use as a mining tool. Able to tear through geological astrogeology with great efficiency, there is little wonder then that it can also tear through ship armour with similar, if incredibly frightening efficiency. If, of course, it can get in range of the enemy.",Anti-Ship,, 
tpc_hmi_hvb,WEAPON,"A bulky energy weapon from an early epoch, this TPC has been tweaked to have a higher damage output and a greater ammunition capacity. Capable of a truly horrifying amount of overwhelming firepower.

Designed before modular energy weapons were universally trusted by Domain naval architects, this weapon was coded into the Onslaught's blueprint because no other hull of the time was large enough or had reactors capable of generating the requisite power.

Even though it's outperformed by some of the later epoch modular designs, the Thermal Pulse Cannon remains an integral part of the Onslaught's arsenal.",Assault,,

lightdualac_rem,WEAPON,"An AI-influenced modification of the Light Dual Autocannon, this weapon utilises the firing ship's flux to charge the kinetic projectile to create electromagnetic arcs on contact with hull.

It is unclear whether the design of this weapon was produced before or after the First AI War. There is clearly an AI influence on its design, as a lot of the components are almost too perfect in shape and size, or are utilised in inexplicable ways that just seem to work.

drone_blitz_borer,SHIP,"A borer drone with vastly improved engines and maneuvering thrusters, this little drone is able to dodge, duck, and weave, all while suppressing ships and countering torpedoes with their mining lasers.",,,
support_bombardment_drone,SHIP,"This stripped down drone is a Mining Drone wing with the lasers replaced with missile racks packed with  a weaker version of the Annhilator, and the engine overtuned for maximum speed. Useful as a bullet magnet and giving limited missile support against already battered enemies. Limited to 2 per wing due to the complexity of the cracked missile loading system.",,,
heavy_shepherd_borer,SHIP,"An uparmed, up armed Mining Drone, this unit is used to shield its host Shepherd vessel while also providing fire support. The nature of the LAI governing the unit requires it to remain close to its parent.",,,
drone_terminator_8,SHIP," Designed to roam far from the Tempest, this drone is armed with an ion pulsar and a weak shield generator. If this threat is not dealt with swiftly, it can very quickly becripple enemy ships.",,,
drone_terminator_7,SHIP,"While this drone is armed with a less impressive pulse laser, it is equipped with both a phase field and a phase skimmer. This turns this drone into a slippery, annoying and dangerous foe, able to strike surgically and escape unharmed.",,,
hmi_scale,SHIP,"The Scale support fighter is based on an old fighter LPC chip, which was armed with an outdated anti-fighter missile system. Replacing the glorified flare launchers with Mbeke Rocket Pods, these ships are able to provide an effective stream of ordinance to pressure shields and punish larger targets. A small rocket pool and the poor light machine gun-based point defence system prevent this fighter from wandering too far from its parent ship.",,,
hmi_shell,SHIP,"The Shell Drone is a simplistic but effective construction. The basis of the frame is an old, slow, heavily plated constructor bot, with a light machine gun bolted into what was the cargo bay. The sturdiness of the craft combined with an effective mounting set up enables the craft to fire farther than normal. The resulting remotely controlled vessel is incredibly durable, and effective at point defense. Useful for catching missiles rather than shooting them down, when used en mass these ships can quickly become troublesome.",,,
hmi_nail,SHIP,"This fighter is based on a fighter LPC found in a lost Tri Tachyon facility. A somewhat fragile fighter design armed with an IR pulse laser, this ship is useful in many different roles without being a master of one.",,,
drone_feeder,SHIP,"Small, weaponised Mess colonies, these drones are individually very weak. However, they often appear en mass, overwhelming point defense systems. On contact with targets,  they will acquire new material from ships, essentially stripping armour from any target they come into contact with and increasing the risk of Mess Infection. Often the only solution to these swarms is strong point defense, and quick elimination of the swarm's source.",,,
drone_feeder_heavy,SHIP,"Something of a refined Mess mini-colony, this amalgamation of nanites and weapons services as a heavy fighter with fairly strong weaponry. When massed these can overwhelm fighter screens and point defense systems, clearing the way for their smaller brethren.",,,
drone_remora_scan,SHIP,"Small repair drones, these small drone craft are armed with high intensity scanners which are normally used to detect high value ship parts amongst the wreckage. However, with some modification, they are capable or delivering a sharp EMP burst to enemy ships, acting as a somewhat effective suppression tool in fleet engagements.",,,
hmi_trapdoor,SHIP,"Lacking a cheap bomber option, some enterprising junkers took a Talon, stripped out the weapons and flare system, and applied a simple bomb bay design to the chasis. The resulting crude craft can drop a single, momentum based explosive at high speed from outside point defense range.

remora,SHIP,"Originally a high-tech, nimble shuttle focused on after-battle ship repair, the Remora has been converted into a combination salvage and survey ship to rival the Shepherd. The repair drones have been altered to not only acquire space-borne scrap, but also deliver a steady EMP disruption to targets. These drones are incredibly effective at disabling smaller targets, and harassing larger ships, however their weapons lack the missile targetting algorithms, making them pointless point defense escorts.",,,
shepherd_heavy,SHIP,"With additional weapon mounts, more armour plating, and a new hacked drone manufactory, this Shepherd modification is a hard nut for isolated pirate patrols to crack. Unfortunately the resultant increase to mass has inhibited ship maneuverability, the size of the new hacked drone bay required the removal of the shield generator to fit, and the ship lacks just about any sort of mining functionality. Nevertheless, the Crook is considered to be an effective convoy escort and frigate hunter-killer.",,,
shepherd_light,SHIP,"A Shepherd that has been completely stripped out, the Whiskey Priest focuses the entire function of the vessel on mining. Cargo space, fuel tanks, weapon systems and the shield generator have all been chucked, replaced with an extra drone bay. The drone bays have also been hacked to produce Blitz Drones, a derivative of borer drone with drastically improved engine efficency. All of these changes not only makes the ship shocking fragile, but the vessel also lacks the ability to contain mined material, instead relying on additional ships for cargo space. If some madman wanted to, the ship can work as a moderately effective support carrier for small-scale combat.",,,
tempest_7,SHIP,"A rare experimental version of the Tempest, this ship lacks a missile hardpoint and a supplementary ship system to make room for a complex drone bay. The resulting Tempest Drone is equipped with a phase drive, enabling it to nimbly dance around the battlefield, quickly striking at enemies before dancing away, while also providing limited point defence for the Tempest. Often highly sought after by both avid collectors and experienced Tri-Tachyon executives.",,,
tempest_8,SHIP,"A prototype of the Tempest with a truly mythical reputation, this vessel was constructed with the idea of mass production without using complicated drone assemblies. The new drone system allowed for the inclusion of an active flare launcher and a small missile mounting, improving the combat ability of the base Tempest. Further, the ion pulser armed drone proves to be incredibly effective at disabling and damaging targets. These systems combined, however, caused considerable strain the the existing ship systems, which made it very difficult to run for exteded periods, as well as causing continual problems off the battlefield. While this model never made it into mass production, several prototype models were produced, and are hungrily sought after by not only Tri-Tachyon executives and collectors, but also just about every single skilled pilot in the sector.",,,
scarab_prototype,SHIP,"An incredibly rare modification of the Scarab bourne from the engineering standpoint that the Temporal Shell system was unfeasible and constructed from a beaurocratic mix-up, this vessel bears heavier ordinance and a phase skimmer.

During the development of the Scarab, there was a period of time where the feasibility of using the temporal device came into question. The problem lay less in the functionality of the device, and more in the manufacture of key components of the engine, meaning that even limited runs of the vessel would number in the single digits. During this particularly troublesome time, several designers and engineers attached to the project created an alternative Scarab hull comprised of fair more common components, just in case the project fell through. Luckily the production issues of the Temporal Shell technology were ironed out and the sketched design was consigned to the archives. However, during a later production run of the Scarab, the constructor file associated with this theoretical prorotype was accidentally used instead of the pre-existing Scarab. Tritachyon contractors on-site, realising they had half-completed hulls of an unfinished design when they should be producing a highly refined and expensive hull, quickly remade the hull on the fly to create this version of the Scarab. In a moment of sheer innovation and gut-wrenching anxiety, the contractors produced a surprisingly robust hull that replaced the temporal device with a phase skimmer, and six of the front mounts with two medium-sized mounts. The contractors were still charged with stealing the existing temporal engine technology and liquidated accordingly, with all the hulls produced seized for refitting with the appropriate ship system. Rather curiously, this hull very rarely appears from time to time in Tritachyon fleets, whether as one of the assets taken from the original project, or completely new hulls based on the existing slapdash design.",,,
hmi_appeasement,SHIP,"An incredibly rare prototype of the Afflictor bourne from the engineering standpoint that the Phase Cloak was unfeasible, this vessel mounts a degraded version of the Entropy Amplifier.

Phase Cloaking is an advanced piece of technology, and some individuals within Tri-Tachyon percieved that its widespread implementation would be impossible. This was due to the expense of the drive, the long-term effects of sustained p-space exposure on crew and officers, and the reliability of the cloak itself. Consequently a limited run of 'phaseless' prototypes were produced, however these ships repeatedly ran into problems with their extraneous systems. In the case of the Forgiveness, the Entropy Amplifier was difficult to charge up, as a large part of the system required the time dilation effect provided by the phase cloak. The Entropy Accelerator system was the compromise, which provided similar effects to the Accelerator while not requiring the phase cloak system.  After review, it was determined that the ship itself lacked the punch of the normal Afflictor for rather nebulous benefits. The Forgiveness-class was officially decomissioned and converted into Afflictors, however several hulls were taken by paranoid Tri-Tachyon Executives who were still skeptical of the long-term effects of spending time outside of normal space, and they are very occassionally spotted in Tri-Tachyon fleets.",,,
lasher_hmi,SHIP,"A retrofit of the Lasher hull, the Barber is an efficient mining vessel, and a somewhat effective ship-mining instrument.

The Barber-class mining frigate is a retrofitted Lasher hull modified to hold a Marx Machine Drill. Combined with improved armour for protection from asteroid debris, and expanded cargo holds to hold ores, the Barber modification is widely praised for it's mining ability. The modifications have compromised several systems, including the removal of the forward ballistic mounts and shield generator to make room for the Marx Drill, heavier armour and additional cargo holds, but considering the huge possible economic advantages of such a ship these niggling little foibles are often ignored. In combat, the Barber is oft reknowned for catching unwary pirates off guard, as with minimal modification the ship's engines can be thrown into overdrive to send the ship into enemy formations - with the drill at the front able to efficiently tear through ship armour. Such a maneuver is incredibly risky however, as the total lack of shield and somewhat small frame means that surviving the make contact with the enemy can prove difficult.",,,
cerberus_miner,SHIP,"Space Miners, seeing the advantages of the Cerberus blueprint, have tweaked and tinkered with the design for ages. A somewhat well-known design, the Khorkhoi replaces the forward medium ballistic mount with a built in mining blaster. Considered to be a fierce competitor to the Shepherd, this ship boasts decent cargo, armour and armament - even if said armament immediately maxes out the flux capacitors on firing.",,,
maunderer,SHIP,"While the Wayfarer is a rather ubiquitous combat freighter, this modification is not. The Maunderer is a rather strange combination of Shepherd and Wayfarer, with two borer drone bays and a medium energy mount for mining weapons. Further, the ship maintains good cargo capacity, and has an attached gantry for salvage operations. The costs of these desirable characteristics is a reduced number of weapon mounts, the vessel's engines have not been upgraded to accomodate the enhanced salvage gantry and drone bays making it slower than expected, and the sheer mass of equipment aboard makes the ship expensive to maintain.",,,
finch,SHIP,"An old model found by Hazard Mining Incorporated, it's unclear whether this ship was a precursor to the Cerberus, or a modification of the Pegasus (now colloquially known as the Mudskipper). Nevertheless, this shuttle is an effective small freighter, able to carry an impressive amount of cargo at acceptable speed. Most worryingly, however, this ship lacks the ability to turn properly and lacks proper ship defenses making it vulnerable to flanking movement during escapes.",,,
hmi_shotglass,SHIP,"This 'ship' is not so much a space-worthy vessel, but more of a mobile artillery piece.

The design was originally an old drunkard's attempt to convert a useless transport drone into an effective combat shuttle. After said designer had drunk himself to death, the horrifically terrible design was passed around as a fake LPC; people would gamble away the chip as a 'LPC of an original design', only to reveal this piece of spaceborne trash on analysis once the gambler had departed. The design eventually entered into the pocket of an enterprising member of HMI with poor card skills, who then mass produced these cheap hulls to make a surprisingly effective swarm fleet. Comprised of nothing but weapon mountings, flux systems to support the weapons, and an engine to move the weapons, this ship is laughably fragile. However, the fact that this nimble vessel possesses disproportionate ordinance for it's size, and is fairly cheap, means that it masses well, and functions effectively as a cheap escort. Further, considering its literally comprised of floating junk, it's fairly easy to improve on the design the more damaged it becomes.",,,
hmi_greasy,SHIP,"A huge logistical vessel used by Hazard Mining Incorporated, this hulking vessel can double as a combat capital and fight off small pirate fleets.

During exploration of an ancient Domain facility, the Hazard Mining Company discovered the LPC for a ship of truly gigantic proportions. The ship was a complete monster, able to hold truly gargantuan amounts of cargo and move it at incredibly fast speed in real space - rumoured to be the design chip of one of the legendary Gate Haulers. However, the titanic vessel was far too large to be constructed with present ship building technology - even the starforges of Chicomoztec would struggle to produce this monstrously huge design in under twelve centuries of continous work. Before the design was locked away in the archives a particularly sharp director noted that the hull was held together with small, yet very sturdy modular nodes, which individually could be easily assembled. The structural node was isolated from the design, hacked into an LPC, and then loaded with weaponry to produce the Greasy, so named because of how difficult it is to rub out. Considering most of the ship is simply added bits and pieces to a very sturdy base, the hull has a high degree of tunability, with the ship becoming more flexible in composition the older it gets.",,,
hmi_snail,SHIP,"This ship is little more than a cargo container with enough accruments of space-ship navigation to be classed as a 'vessel'.

A product of bizarre circumstances, the Snail was originally produced when an enterprising student of engineering attempted to hack a ship into existance using the blueprints of a cargo container, a flak cannon, and disparate engine parts from other designs. The original blueprint produced a very sturdy prototype made out of scrap. During its maiden voyage across the spacedock, a Hazard Mining Incorporated privateer blasted the spacedock, stole the ship, and left, leaving behind a very bewildered student in the Nortia space dock. On raiding the ship's cargo holds, only to reveal the ship was loaded with heavy trash and not high-value cargo, the main Privateer quickly said that this cutting edge design of a ship was the real prize. Needless to say said Privateer was shot out of the airlock, but the ship was kept, mostly as a mascot. Said mascot was, inexplicably, the only surviving craft after a later attack by the Luddic Path. Finding themselves in a cloud of debris in hostile space, the desperate crew reworked the ship into a semi-functioning combat vessel using parts found on the rapidly dispersing battlefield. Quickly they found exactly how amazing hardy, and how ridiculously modular the ship was, as they were able to attach more and more systems to the ship. After several close calls with Luddites, Pirates and Scavangers, the crew eventually made it home, where the vessel they sailed passed into legend - and later into a hacked LPC blueprint called by the same name originally spray-painted on the hull, 'The Snail'.",,,
hmi_streak,SHIP,"Brutal but brittle, this lightning quick attack vessel can hit well above its very, very small weight.

This ship was produced by accident when a Hazard Mining engineer attempted to change the output of a modular autofac producing Heavy Machinery. The engineer was hoping to produce a much more complicated and higher value product, but instead it produced a mangle of engine parts and structural components. On being finally constructed, the engines on the hunk of junk spontaneously ignited and shot the scrap heap out of the autofac, clipping a Buffalo and destroying thousands of credits worth of food. The engineer's supervisor, bemused, took the design and, with some hacking from a Lasher blueprint, produced the Streak. Fragile and fast, the Streak is an aggresive attack vessel composed only of weapons, flux capacitors and an engine that doubles as the primary structural support.",,,
marlin,SHIP,"The design of this ship (amongst others) was located on a techmining expedition far beyond the core worlds from the remnants of an old Polity. The entire ship range was extracted intact, however the components needed to assemble the discovered hulls are not in circulation, needing refined assembly technqiues that have since been lost due to the Collapse. While the larger ship designs discovered could not be constructed without these components, the smallest one could. This vessel, while being the most inferior of the designs, is still superior to many ships of its size class available today. With a flux-efficient built-in energy blaster, fantastic agility, and very attractive flux statistics, the Marlin is an effective but rare frigate in Company patrols.",,,
hmi_charlie,SHIP,"A successful attempt to up-armour and up-arm the Gremlin, the Charlie (also called the Muntz) is a cheap, heavily armoured if sluggish phase ship with a dangerous weapons layout.",,,
wolf_assault,SHIP,"An uncommon derivative of the Wolf, this ship has heavier armour and ballistic integration in all of its small mounts.

A rather strange design, the Wolf (Assault) was a work of love by a completely unknown ship designer. This is because the design was stolen from the designer by another designer, which was then stolen again by yet another designer. Once lawsuits were made and settled by a startling amount of bloody assassinations and reprisals, the whole matter was left in the air as to who actually had the rights to the ship design. With the company at large unwilling to pursue an intensive legal matter over what could be argued to be an inferior Wolf design, the hull was consigned to obscurity. However, acquisition of the ship design has become something of a right of passage for hackers within the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, and as a result the hull design is passed on and quietly producely  quasi-legally for curious ship designers and avid collectors.

hammerhead_tt,SHIP,"The Hammerhead is a well-respected vessel due to it's versatile ballistic loadout and good staying power. Naturally the Tri-Tachyon Corporation would investigate a high-tech refit of the vessel, however modification of the vessel often ran into issues. Sometimes the project itself had its funding redirected to other sources, other times the project itself was just a front for embezzlement, and yet other times the modifications did not meet the design goals set out by the Executive Design Commitee. The Hammerhead (TT) only passed the prototype stage when a Mayasuran with a deep affinity and love of the Hammerhead chasis came up with a fairly workable design independantly of Tri-Tachyon attempts. She was quickly recruited, and she now heads  the Hammerhead (TT) development project, of which this is a prototype model. With a more energy-based loadout and a mini-burn system, this flexible ship can wear down enemies at range with ballistics before leaping in to finish them off with energy-based weapony.",,,
hammerhead_hmi,SHIP,"The Hammerhead is not often seen in the outer reaches of the sector, and when one comes about it is often found to be relatively uneconomical to run. The solution was suggested by Haseo Fuyutsuki himself: take the Hammerhead hull, and apply Buffalo containers to the empty space of the vessel. This wouldn't resolve the economy of the ship, but would improve its versatility to the point where the cost could be justified. Hacking this design was very straightforward, however the resulting ship was incredibly sluggish and lacked the punch the Hammerhead possesses. Additional alterations had to be made, and it was these more experimental changes that resulted in the vessel succumbing to combat strain much sooner than the base Hammerhead. Nevertheless, the Vidit is an effective combat freighter that is seeing increasing interest in the sector at large.",,,
brasher,SHIP,"After a pirate attack during the Collapse, a desperate team of mining engineers constructed a ship from various remaining parts from the ruins of their convoy. When the pirates returned they were easily able to overwhelm the shoddily built ship, but the basis of the design caught the attention of the raiding party. They later joined up with the Company as privateers, and after a joke spoken about the ship over drinks, a design was quickly whipped up by a Company engineer to produce the first iteration of the Brasher. With a reworked design for increased construction efficiency and to allow for additional weapon mounts, the Brasher is a brutal ship.  Often the choice for the knife-fighting seargent or the close support artillery officer, this ship is capable of dumping ludicrous amounts of forward facing firepower. Unfortunately, it's let down by the absence of an efficient shield generator and non-existent point defence options, requiring an escort to achieve maximum potential.",,,
cockroach,SHIP,"At its core this ship has parts of a chasis of a proto-hammerhead model with far too many support struts and solid hull plating. Tacked onto this incomplete design are bits and pieces from salvaged and scavenged light craft, brought together to create a rickety old bastard of a ship. Well reknowned for personalization, these ships quickly adopt a character all of their own as damaged systems are overlayed with improved upgrades. For all their possibility for modification, it should be stressed that these ships are ultimately floating junk piles, and will wither against a more well-constructed enemy.",,,
zebu,SHIP,"Comprised of bits and pieces of buffaloes, cerberi, hounds, asteroids and general space junk, the Zebu is a hardy ship. Able to be bashed completely to a pulp, and then easily put back together, this ship is a useful, cheap cargo hauler. Not useful in a stand up fight, but should be able to survive long enough to burn away.",,,
mule_hmi_heavy,SHIP,"A product of enevitability, this up-armed modification of the Mule removes some of the cargo space, and adds two medium ballistics, a flight deck and two small missile hardpoints at the front. Further, the engines were replaced with vastly more fuel-efficient versions, and a surveying suite integrated into the vessel's systems. With a superior logistics profile and fuel efficiency, combined with an effective weapons loadout, this ship is perfect for the budding explorer.",,,
mule_hmi_light,SHIP,"The Donkey is a ramshackle vessel for mining - and not much else. Just about everything from weapons to armour to cargo space have been judiciously removed, and replaced with drone bays. With three Blitz Drone manufactories the ship can strip resource rich areas with ease, however they will require support vessels to contain the mined material. The sacrifice of the ship's combat capabilities make the vessel hilariously fragile, however the Blitz Drones enable the ship to provide at least some fighter cover in small enganements.",,,
mule_hmi_x,SHIP,"This pirate modification to the Dromedary removes the hangar bay and front missile hardpoints, replacing it with a large missile hardpoint. With additional scavenged engines, this ship can be terrifyingly effective in many roles, posing a horrible foe for bounty hunters, traders, and even small patrols. The only saving grace for the hapless victims of this ship is the heavy modifications to an already modified ship rapidly burns out the ship systems, causing it to rapidly lose effectiveness in extended engagements.",,,
nebula_hmi,SHIP,"The Nebula is one of the most common destroyer-sized vessels in the Sector. Highly desired for their ability to carry passengers long distance, to the standard Hazard miner these ships are only useful as salvage - or conversion into a Nebulite. With the ship's passenger compartments removed and replaced with mining pod bays, cargo compartments, a salvage gantry and a more energy based layout, the Nebulite is a mean mining and salvage vessel. Unfortunately the alterations to the Nebulite does not improve on engine efficiency, making the ship much slower, and the upkeep of the jam-packed features is disproportionately high for it's size.",,,
shrike_prototype,SHIP,"A rare modification of the Shrike, this limited-run prototype bears a Temporal Shell system, but suffers from reduced performance time and increases maintenance costs.

While the Scarab was considered to be a rather fantastic experimental platform for the Temporal Shell device, several designers and pilots within the Tritachyon Corporation disagreed, as they determined that the decentralised weapon layout of the Scarab simply did not harness the full power of the system. To refine the system in depth, key designers examined the Shrike hull as a possible hull for Temporal Shell implementation. After several design passes this version of the Shrike was created, with a very limited run of test models produced. The resulting hull was an absolute horror to behold on the field of battle, however using the Temporal Shell device on such a comparatively large vessel gravely stressed the ship, preventing extended combat function. Further, creating a Temporal Shell device for this sized vessel is incredibly difficult, necessitating far too much production time for a relatively small number of vessels with limited combat capability. With this in mind the project was put on temporary, and then permament hold. Despite this, the very few hulls produced during the testing phase were bought by Tri-Tachyon Executives, and even today very rarely show up in Tri-Tachyon fleets and markets.",,,
hmi_pardon,SHIP,"An incredibly rare prototype of the Harbringer bourne from the engineering standpoint that the Phase Cloak was unfeasible, this vessel mounts a degraded version of the Causality Drive and an additional two medium energy mounts and an upgraded large energy mount.

Phase Cloaking is an advanced piece of technology, and some individuals within Tri-Tachyon percieved that its widespread implementation would be impossible. This was due to the expense of the drive, the long-term effects of sustained p-space exposure on crew and officers, and the reliability of the cloak itself. Consequently a limited run of 'phaseless' prototypes were produced, however these ships repeatedly ran into problems with their extraneous systems. In the case of the Appeasement, the Quantum Disruptor was difficult to charge up, as a large part of the system required the temporal detanglement provided by the phase cloak. The Triplet-State Disruptor system was the compromise, which provided similar effects to the Disruptor while not requiring the phase cloak system. To compensate for this the designers added additional ordinance, expanding the middle medium weapon emplacement with a larger mount, and adding two medium energy mounts where the phase cloak drives would normally be placed.  After review, it was determined that the ship itself was an effective artillery vessel, however its disproportionate cost to build and maintain prevented its widespread usage. Further, the competing Ionos already existed and proved to be just as effective. Ships from the limited run are in high demand amongst Tri-Tachyon Executives however, and they are occassionally spotted in Tri-Tachyon fleets piloted by proud and smug Executives.",,,
jakkle,SHIP,"The Jakkle design was received from a techmining colony, mere moments before said colony was destroyed due to a raider attack. The Luddic Church claims the Company of being said raiders, and the Jakkle the blood-stained proof of Company extortion. Regardless of the source, the Jakkle is an effective strike vessel. Using its built-in pair of Khradeh Autocannons to pressure ships until their shields are overloaded, the Jakkle then quickly dashes in with its burst burn ability, before using its impressive missile complement to take advantage of the crippled ship. Unfortunately, the design of the Jakkle has many key issues, such as the Khradeh having oddly poor integration into the structure, windows being installed in vulnerable sections, fire suppression systems that are linked up to the fuel systems instead of the water tanks, along with hundreds of incredibly annoying minor flaws seemingly deliberately integrated into the design - perhaps the last laugh of some poor lost techmining colony.",,,
mulligan,SHIP,"This vessel is a crude attempt to utilize the cheap, low-grade phase coil on the Gremlin on a destroyer-sized chasis. The two phase coils work surprisingly well in tandem without breaking the ship in half, to the point where the heavy ordinance and armour could be installed on the ship without possible phase accidents and p-space disruptions. Designed to brutally push through enemies from unprotected areas, this ship does have structural issues due to the admittedly haphazard construction of the destroyer chasis, and the heavy focus on forward firepower can leave the ship vulnerable if caught out of position.",,,
hmi_wobbie,SHIP,"The Wobbie is a destroyer-sized attempt to use the Gremlin's primitive phase drive. The general principle was to put as much armour and armament  around the circular phase drive as possible, while maintaining the ships ability to remain in p-space. The result is a heavy thug of a ship that can phase for short periods of time, however the high degree of overtuning required to make the Wobbie function correctly has negative consequences on prolonged use in combat.",,,
hmi_convict,SHIP,"A somewhat simple design, the Convict was produced when a LPC hack of a Mora and a Condor went wrong somewhere along the line. However, with perserverence and dedication, the design was eventually refined into a semi-usable form - which was then promptly stolen by an agent of Hazard Mining Incorporated. With a highly-modular substructure that can be easily reconstructed around several fighter manufactories and missile arsenals, the Convict is a suitable carrier option if one doesn't mind how slow and fragile it is.",,,
hmi_creep,SHIP,"Unlike a lot of Junker designs, the Creep was actually designed right from the beginning to be deliberately modular and cheap in its construction. A product of a desperate polity during the collapse, this design was produced with the idea of out-producing the enemy with low quality ships. While said polity was able to successfully fight off pirate raids, they could not fight the rapid depopulation of their forces. Eventually the polity dissolved coincidentally about the time Hazard Mining showed up, who were able to acquire the design from fleeing survivors of the polity's ruling caste. Fast and brutal, the Creep is mostly engine and weapons systems, with not a lot else to hold it together.",,,
category,SHIP,"Discovered in a techmining operation somewhere far east of the core worlds, the history of the Category is completely unknown. The design was found in a safe buried in the middle of a blasted plain on a ruin-covered world, with no record of the planet's name, let alone the name of the cratered plains. The design of this ship is corrupted with several minor issues occuring during production due to missing entries and unaccessible lines of code, which often required deft application of low-quality parts and repeated clicking of the 'Ignore Errors' button on the holodisplay. The result is an effective light artillery destroyer with a strong ballistic complement, an accelerated ammo feeder system, and decent armour.",,,
marinas,SHIP,"A sophisticated design, the Marinas is a very aesthetically appealing vessel with a focus on energy weaponry. This advanced design was sourced from the floating ruins of a gas giant south of the core worlds, although whether the ruins existed before or after Hazard Mining Incorporated showed up is unclear. The unique feature of the Marinas is its Time Accelerator system. This unusual version of the Temporal Shell system does not dilute time across the entire vessel, instead only accelerating time in the weapon and flux systems. While the system does not grant the ship improved agility or reaction time, it does enable the ship to temporarily hit well above its weight without overly stressing the ship's subsystems. While the ship does have truly impressive combat ability, the construction of the vessel is plagued with issues due to a shortage of delicate machinery and a large number of systems that appear to be purely aesthetic, and yet with their removal causes the Time Accelerator system to inexplicably malfunction and destroy half the autofactory during testing.",,,
calico,SHIP,"The design of the Calico was recovered interestingly enough from an archeaological dig investigating a Pre-Domain site. While sifting amongst old vidphones and vision screens, an anachronistic package was found which contained this design along with evidence of post-collapse technology. How this package managed to appear buried kilometers below the surface in a long-lost pre-Domain colony is a complete mystery, but it's sale to the Company more than covered the dig's expenses. The Calico is a combat carrier with a focus on very strong shields and ample flux capacitance to weather incoming fire, while using its fighter complement and weapon systems to destroy targets. While the design is uncorrupted and the components used in the ship's construction are not difficult to source, it is believed that there is something wrong with the design due to repeated issues with the ships subsystems that often require repairs to be repeated multiple times.",,,
ascendate,SHIP,"Early in Haseo Fuyutsuki's career, he entered into a ship auction hoping to acquire an LPC for the Sunder for his budding Company. He bid on what he thought was the design he desired, but once the bidding had ended he discovered he had won the worn and apparently partially eaten LPC of the Ascendante. This makes the Ascendate rather novel as one of the few ship designs the company acquired through perfectly legitimate means - that can also be comfirmed by third parties, at least. The Ascendate is in many regards an up-armoured Sunder. A lot of the underlying infrastructure is similar, except there is considerably more armour and hull reinforcement applied to the ship. A generous weapons layout and a large energy mount completely encased in armour and hidden from view ensures that this brawler of a ship can weather a fair amount of punishment. However, the ship itself is painfully slow and due to the original LPC of the Ascendante being damaged, unexpected issues can arise rather quickly after prolonged engagement.",,,
prognosticator,SHIP,"The Prognosticator is an awkward light destroyer chassis due to its shape and size. This is because the ship is actually the acruments of starfaring wrapped around a top-secret, experimental engine. This mechanism, according to eye-witness reports, is able to cause target vessels to slow down in speed, fire rate and venting. Secretive testing of scavanged target ships appear to indicate some type of time dilation is involved. Consequently, despite appearing quite weak and vulnerable, this ship is a powerful support vessel, which should be eliminated at the earliest opportunity.",,,

#CRUISER CRUISER CRUISER,,,,,
scarecrow,SHIP,"The result of a rich Warlord wanting the have the biggest and best Eagle, the designs for the Scarecrow were stolen from the grip of his cold dead hands by ""Hazard"" Fuyutsuki himself. Unfortunately the design was not complete, and the various missing parts often resulted in the ship shearing in half if it moved too quickly. This ship has seen repeated design passes and refinements to try and make it into a somewhat functional vessel at the direction of Fuyutsuki as well - although whether he was interested in a heavy cruiser for the Company, or because he too wanted the biggest and best Eagle in the sector is unclear. With additional substructure reinforcement the ship was able to perform more high speed movement without cracking in two, and more weapons systems were integrated. At some point in the design process a fighter bay was added to the front to provide additional support, and later large ballistic mounts were integrated to give the ship more punch. The result is a very heavy cruiser with a generous weapons layout, let down by sluggish controls and several design issues that prevent the ship from seeing extended engagement.",,,
aurora_s,SHIP,"During the prototypical stages of design, Tri-Tachyon engineers explored a variety of routes to increase the effectiveness of the Aurora hull. This prototypical hull focused on improving the fire output and range of the ship to create an artillery vessel comparable to a miniature Paragon. While the addition of an improved targeting system, modifications to the weapon output to improve range, and the inclusion of a large energy mount made the ship a better damage dealer, the hull was easily overwhelmed when encountering many smaller craft. Further, additional capacitance could not be added, nor the formidable Fortress Shield be installed, both due to limitations in the hull and expense. While the current Aurora, with it's nimble engine system, became the cruiser of choice, a few of these original prototypes were still made and put into military service. Nowadays, the Aurora (S) is nothing more than an interesting relic of a design process rather than actual combat vessel, only sought after by the richest of collectors.",,,
fury_s,SHIP,"Something of a vanity project, the Fury (Assault) is the product of the singular vision of Tri-Tachyon Executive Ashley Prince. While the Fury was designed to pounce on weakened enemies to exploit an opening, Prince felt that the ship should be able to wade into the enemy fleet and make the opening to begin with. With exceptional investment and harsh design reiterations, the Fury Prince Assault Model was eventually produced. Substantially heavier and more expensive to maintain and deploy, the ship possessed exceptional flux capacity and superb shield integrity. While the ship itself was adequeate for Prince's vision, widespread implementation was never carried out as a ship designed to get stuck into the enemy simply did not fit within the prevailing idea of mobile warfare within the company. Only a very limited run of these were produced for Executive Prince and a couple of their more aggressive-minded associates, and thus are very rarely seen in Tri-Tachyon fleets.",,,
hippocampus,SHIP,"Taking note of the rapidly changing situation in the Persean Sector, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation investigated an alternative to the Venture that could deal with the new chaotic realities they found themselves in. The culmination of this research was the Hippocampus, a modification of the Gemini with improved flux systems, a conversion to a more flexible weapons and flight deck loadout, and the inclusion of a very sophisticated range of photometric scanners, deep-terrain sensors and atmosphere characterisation equipment that drastically reduces the workload cost required to carry out a survey. The cost of the 'Hippo's attractive capabilities is a drastic loss in cargo space and relatively high logistical profile, requiring a sizeable investment in support vessels to support it.",,,
roach_king,SHIP,"Originally a product of desperation, the original Roach King was devised as a stop-gap defensive vessel against Hazard Mining Incorporated. The desperate defenders of some now forgotten polity had taken a piece of their destroyed station, attached engines, weapons and assorted space junk, and used it as the flagship for their rag-tag fleet. Unfortunately this first vessel was lacking in maneuvering thrusters, and during the pivotal battle the ship ended up flying straight through the HMI formation and into the system's star. The HMI, however, saw the potential in weaponising otherwise useless station parts from their conquests, and thus the current iteration of the Roach King was born. Shockingly hardy, this ship can wither truly horrific amounts of damage and come back for more. Furthermore, if the ship were to somehow be destroyed, it can be reconstructed in more favourable and far more terrible forms. This ship however is notoriously sluggish, and regularly costs a pretty penny in repair costs.",,,
slugworth,SHIP,"The Mora is often used as the beginning of a colony or mining center on alien worlds, with the main structure buried in the ground and used as the basis of later colonial structures. On considering this, Company scavangers often try the reverse: taking a colony building, attaching engines to it, and attempting to use the building as a space-faring vessel. These makeshift ships almost always have mixed to poor results, never gaining a vessel designation according to official Hegemony Ship lists due to the floating buildings  never lasting long enough in large enough numbers to be recognised. The single exclusion to this are vessels based on the Slugworth Organics Pumping Station, which are officially recognised as a class of cruiser. The Slugworth building was originally built to be modular for ease of transport, and be assembled in high corrosion and high pressure environments on otherwise toxic worlds. With very little alteration the structure could be converted into a resiliant if sluggish carrier, something which many Company scavanger captains leap upon due to ease of acquisition from colony wreckage or simply constructing the 'ship' themselves. Due to the modular construction, it is incredibly easy to reassemble in case of destruction - with some choice alterations often added by discerning scavangers.",,,
sulemain,SHIP,"Recovered from the ruins of a long-passed polity (and this time around, it actually was long passed), the Suleiman is an incomplete design. The core of the ship including engines, reactor, flight deck and some weapon mounts are intact, however large portions of the ship are missing from the blueprint either due to corruption or deletion. The intact regions are incredibly intriguing due to the presence of aberrant design features, like a large energy mount that is fitted into the roof of the hangar bay, and an incredibly efficient engine reactor. Hazard Mining, seeing the huge potential of this vessel, decided to simply hack on parts from other designs to the ship, producing a strange mish-mash of high tech excellence tempered by low tech stability. The product of this process is the Suleiman, a frighteningly aggresive heavy cruiser with good flux stats, a very good weapons layout, and a much covetted plasma jet system. While the design works as intended, the same discontinuity between high tech and low tech regions can result in problems during construction and repair, often requiring improvisation and ingenuity to keep the vessel running.",,,
weaver,SHIP,"On investigating an old Domain-Era facility, the Company located a weapons system that was based on the Thermal Pulse Cannon. The design was a major improvement, with additional integrated weapons systems and truly astounding flux systems. These features, while primative to Domain-Era technology, are miles ahead of current technology in the post-Collapse Persean sector, and thus the Company sought to turn this platform into a useable weapons system. However there was a key problem - the design was originally made to test the new Thermal Pulse Cannon and how it behaved with other weapons and shield systems 'in vacuo', and not for combat trials. The Company, not to be deterred, took the design, and hacked on engines and a reactor to the design to produce the Weaver. With very good combat stats, the ship suffers from poor movement and high maintenance, as the weapons systems was not designed to see combat.",,,
hmi_ionos,SHIP,"Designed to provide tactical flexibility to the discerning commander, the Ionos can act both as a close support vessel with its large energy mount, or as an attack vessel with its generous hardpoint layout and High Energy Focus system. However, to accomodate the large turret in the relatively small frame, cut-backs prevented weapons mounted in the large turret from aiming forwards, thus in order to use the mount the ship itself needs to physically rotate, preventing simultaneous use with the forward hardpoints. Consequently this ship can occupy either a close support or assault vessel role, but never at the same time.",,,
hmi_forgiveness,SHIP,"An incredibly rare prototype of the Doom bourne from the engineering standpoint that the Phase Cloak was unfeasible, this vessel mounts a degraded version of the Mine Strike and considerably more ordinance.

This was due to the expense of the drive, the long-term effects of sustained p-space exposure on crew and officers, and the reliability of the cloak itself. Consequently a limited run of 'phaseless' prototypes were produced, however these ships repeatedly ran into problems with their extraneous systems. In the case of the Pardon, the existing Mine Strike system was unable to teleport mines onto the target, as a large part of the system required the phase cloak to transport the explosive charge. A more prototypical analogue of the system was implemented, but its performance left a lot to be desired. To compensate for this the designers added additional ordinance, adding two large energy and two medium energy mounts where the phase cloak drives would normally be placed.  Only a very, very limited number of this vessel were ever produced, as it was a derivative of an already secret vessel before review, and after it was determined that the Doom was simply more effective in its role despite the Pardon's fearsome firepower. The ship, however, is still seen rarely  in Tri-Tachyon fleets under the control of the more covetous, collection-inclined Senior Executives.",,,

junk,SHIP,"The original design of the Junk was widespread throughout the Domain some many, many, MANY cycles ago. Some say they were even rumoured to be precursors to the Gate Haulers of legend. What is apparent, however, is their large size, incredible bulk and terrible engine power meant they were quickly outclassed by comparatively smaller and more efficient designs, such as the Atlas. Thus the Junk was to be consigned to the history books - had a wreck and its incomplete plans not been discovered in an ancient Domain facility by Hazard Mining Incorporated. Now the well defined chasis is used as the framework for the attachment of many, many cargo pods, massive fuel tanks, large crew quarters, many weapon mounts, bits and pieces of salvaged ships, and even the integration of a weapon more at home on a defense satellite. Huge, lumbering and well armoured, this ship is able to fight off smaller pirate attacks all on it's own. This ship is used by the H.M.I. to bring the many tons of raw goods from the Outer Rim to the Core Systems, and many tons of supplies, weapons and marines back out to the Outer Rim.",,,
fishkill,SHIP,"The design of this hulk is shrouded in secrecy and obscurity. Some say it was based on a rumoured pirate attempt to reverse engineer the Astral, while others say it was an aquatic mining vessel reconstructed in space, and yet others claim that it was simply a junker design that just happened to be functional. Regardless of the source, Hazard Mining Incorporated immediately acquired the design, as the ample weapon slots, large fighter bays and the simplicity of integrating mining and salvage equipment into the hull turned this ship into a versatile capital option. Able to rapidly strip mine ore sources with ease, provide a significant contribution to salvage, and swarm smaller fleets with its numerous fighter wings, the Fishkill is an incredibly effective support vessel. Unfortunately, despite its good support capability the ship itself is sluggish, has a weak shield generator, and has poor flux stats, meaning it can very easily be overwhelmed by enemy ships.",,,

Salvaging the pieces and reverse-engineering the design, along with implementation of other technologies similarly found by the Company, Hazard Mining was able to reconstruct the vessel and its LPC. Currently the Herakles is a somewhat uncommon sight in Company fleets; after all, it's often easier and cheaper to construct smaller junk ships or salvage an old ship, than it is to construct this dedicated battleship that suffers from severe degradation after its peak time expires due to the many conflicting technologies at work in the ship.

First the primary missile mounts have been replaced with flight decks, reinforcement has been added to the underlying super structure, and the Thermal Pulse Cannons have been tweaked to have a higher damage output and larger magazines. What makes this vessel particularly dangerous is its movement system which, after a brief period of preparation, accelerates the ship at high speed towards the enemy - a feature which catches other captains by complete surprise. 

When first launched from orbital dock, they must have surely dwarfed any other ship in existence and intimidated entire systems. Some even say that they were built to combat non-humans in a long forgotten war. Much later, Domain engineers made modifications to the blueprints to include a shield system, upgraded the FTL drives, and reduced the necessary crew complement through automation and iterative engineering. Even though more advanced blueprints are available, the Onslaught remains the easiest to manufacture due to the brutal simplicity of its systems. 

A ship designed without shields in mind, built to be able to withstand a heavy barrage of enemy fire and strike back while protecting its crew is much loved by its officers and crew. And strike back it can; the Onslaught's unmatched ballistic potential can devastate entire fleets in minutes, its only drawback a logistical dependency on ammunition.

Anomaly 12-4C, also known as the Outworks, is something of an oddity that can occassionally coalesce as a consequence of Rampart and Berserker hulls being cannabalised and reassembled by autonomous construction units. The ship itself is simply a commonly observed amalgamation of the modular parts of both hulls being put together into a functional unit. During the Domain's heydey protocols often caught these ships mid construction, causing them to be disassembled and reconstructed properly.

The Object 440 was designed to observe if, using existing Exploratorium autofactory infrastructure, a capital grade Expansion Era shield generator could be produced on an autonomous drone.

On seeing some tests with some chronological altering technology, and percieving it as a possible long-term threat to Exploratorium activities, Huan-Gogel sought out a design that could use their existing war drone infrastructure to compete. Their solution was to integrate components in such a way that they could temporarily be accelerated and overcharged, giving the ship a very short burst of above-average speed. This system, however, could only function for very short periods of time, couldn't be integrated on larger vessels, and required a vent discharge cavity that would run through the drone's structure. The result was the Object 108; relatively underarmed for its size, it moves in quick bursts to flank enemies and can punch well above its size. These features have given it an almost terrifying reputation as the 'Slendership' due to its unsettling movement profile and fearsome strike ability.",,,

Discovered buried in the wreckage of the Mess-Infested Remnant station, this ship is unusual in a variety of ways. The ship itself appears to be based on a Coelum class, except far lighter and faster. Further, the vessel utilises nanomachine Deep Dream generators to repair hull on the process of actively venting flux, enabling it regenerate terrifying amounts of damage on retreating from high-intensity combat situations. The strangest thing of all is the craft possesses all the utilities and interfaces necessary for a human crew to run and maintain the vessel.

Data extracted from the ship's computers indicate that this vessel exists due to the Mess-afflicted AI becoming glitched, and attempting to finish the Coelum project to satisfy an urgent demand by Tri-Tachyon Security. On completion, the AI stored the finished ship, and the ship was then consumed by the Mess, causing the degraded AI to note that it was behind on the demand by Tri-Tachyon Security, and attempt the project again, building on what had already been made before.

Normally these vessel remain inactive outside of standard function, however certain protocols can be activated which can bring these ships to bear to bulk out defense fleets in times of exceptional need.",,,
domres_hmi_sapper,SHIP,"Unlike the standard Domain war-drone, this vessel bears the colours and markings of 'The Domain Resurgent'. Exactly what this organisation is or where it comes from in unclear, however it appears that a large part of its military power was derived from altered versions of automated defense systems, bearing considerably greater combat power than expected of a Domain war-drone.

The Sapper is a rarely seen utility vessel of the automated Exploratorium fleet. This ship is primarily focused on mining, with an eye towards breaking up asteroids and terrestial deposits for later acquisition by Embrasure class craft. In times of stress, these ships can also be outfitted as combat vessels with relative ease by automated systems, however their deployment represents the activation of dire straits by the automated systems.",,,
domres_barbican,SHIP,"Unlike the standard Domain war-drone, this vessel bears the colours and markings of 'The Domain Resurgent'. Exactly what this organisation is or where it comes from in unclear, however it appears that a large part of its military power was derived from altered versions of automated defense systems, bearing considerably greater combat power than expected of a Domain war-drone.

The Hornworks class was a design that uses parts from the larger Rampart and Berserker classes. The craft was used to equip smaller autonomous fleets with heavier ordinance, with the intention to bring heavier firepower without having to make an entirely new design, and to efficiently use resources without having to waste them on a larger ship. For the most part the Hornworks executes its function very efficiently, if only somewhat adequately.",,,
domres_outworks,SHIP,"Unlike the standard Domain war-drone, this vessel bears the colours and markings of 'The Domain Resurgent'. Exactly what this organisation is or where it comes from in unclear, however it appears that a large part of its military power was derived from altered versions of automated defense systems, bearing considerably greater combat power than expected of a Domain war-drone.

Anomaly 12-4C, also known as the Outworks, is something of an oddity that can occassionally coalesce as a consequence of Rampart and Berserker hulls being cannabalised and reassembled by autonomous construction units. The ship itself is simply a commonly observed amalgamation of the modular parts of both hulls being put together into a functional unit. During the Domain's heydey protocols often caught these ships mid construction, causing them to be disassembled and reconstructed properly. However, after many cycles alone on the frontier, autonomous systems can become corrupted, and these ships can emerge in Domain wardrone hangars - and despite their anomalous origins, due to the robustness of the modular construction of Huan-Gogel, these ships are still incredibly dangerous.",,,
domres_rampart,SHIP,"Unlike the standard Domain war-drone, this vessel bears the colours and markings of 'The Domain Resurgent'. Exactly what this organisation is or where it comes from in unclear, however it appears that a large part of its military power was derived from altered versions of automated defense systems, bearing considerably greater combat power than expected of a Domain war-drone.

Little more than an artillery platform with engines, the Rampart was attached to drone units to provide the heavy firepower necessary to meet cruiser and capital class hulls in the line of combat or to crack armoured orbital fortresses. In either role, heavy losses were anticipated, so the Rampart was designed with highly modular components which allowed badly damaged hulls to be rapidly cannibalized to repair lightly damaged hulls up to combat capacity without the need for shipyard facilities.",,,
domres_centurion,SHIP,"Designed for area denial and defense by the Domain Resurgent, this Centurion analogue possesses a Domain-era targeting supercomputer that increases the range and tracking ability of the craft's weapons. While sluggish for a frigate, this ship performs its role of a very effective escort vessel for larger ships with flying colors, being able to both deal and withstand crippling damage.",,,
domres_hammerhead,SHIP,"A midline destroyer from the golden age of the Domain, the Hammerhead is respected for its staying power in battle as well as its ballistic capabilities. This one has a number of refinements from the lost age of the Domain implanted into the structure by the Domain Resurgent. Modifications cause Accelerated Ammo Feeder system to be always active, although with considerably lower efficiency. Ship now bears a Damper Field system, causing it to become incredibly sturdy and effective assault vessel, no doubt useful in most fleets.",,,
domres_eagle,SHIP,"The embodiment of the sleek and powerful space cruiser from the time of the Domain, the Eagle-class ships are a beautiful reminder of the technological and aesthetic achievements of humanity's past. This particular model is straight from that past, designed and constructed by the Domain Resurgent back in its heyday. Instead of being developed for tactical strikes against the enemy, this vessel is designed for a more straightforward assault against formations. With more resilient weapons and engines, this ship can remain combat effective even after taking crippling damage. In almost every other regard, this vessel is identical underneath the added armour to the base Eagle.",,,
domres_mora,SHIP,"Seeing widespread use on the frontier of the Domain as mining vessels and stop-gap colony ships, the Domain Resurgent has taken the chassis and made various alterations to the fighter manufactory. The fighters produced by this ship are much better constructed, hardier and possess improved weapon systems. Combined with the ship's thick armour, solid strutcure and existing Damper Field, the Mora (DomRes) is a frustratingly stubborn ship to dispose of.",,,

station_domres_base,SHIP,"A giant hulk of a vessel which bears the markings of the 'Domain Resurgent'. For all appearances this vessel is reminiscent of a Domain-era Survey Mothership, except with considerably more defensive structures. However a lot of the structure has been torn away by previous engagements, with various scoring from ship weaponry and fighter fire. Exactly what happened to this vessel is unclear, however after slumbering for Ludd-knows how long its defensive protocol is still active, painting your vessel with target finders and scans as you approach.",,,

Internal comms are now lighting up, with many reports of boarding troops and hull breaches and fuel explosions - despite nothing on your console suggesting anything of the sort. A dull, throbbing whine emits from the comms, causing your breathe to quicken, your body to sweat, your head to pound, your vision to narrow.

#FACTIONS,,,,,
HMI,FACTION,"Many cycles ago, a daring space miner called Haseo 'Hazard' Fuyutsuki set out into the Outer Rim to make his fortune with nothing by a Shepherd, some loose change and a dream. Today, the Company he founded holds an iron grip beyond the Core Worlds, always seeking more profit. Made up of adventurers, freebooters and mercenaries, Hazard Mining Incorporated is well known as a company where anyone can make their fortune. It is also well known for being rather... inethical in the acquisition of goods, luxuries and tech from the Outer Rim colonies. The Luddic Church often demands the destruction of the 'Soulless Machine', and other established factions are rendered nervous by the accusations of briganditry, banditry, protection racketteering, and possibly even genocide. But while the Company continues to churn out absurdedly high profits and an endless supply of raw goods, the major factions remain placated...for now...",,,

#Mercy,,,,,
hmi_nuriel,CUSTOM,"A toxic world swept by choking gases and corrosive atmosphere, Nuriel would be considered too hazardous to build any sort of permenant structure on. And yet, inexplicably, a large complex exists on the planet's surface. Said complex has mostly fallen into disrepair, with large sections having been lost over time. However, a portion of the facility was functional enough to allow the local Luddic Sect to set up a crude mining operation to tap into subterranean ore deposits, safe from the dangerous surface atmosphere.",,,
hmi_samiel,CUSTOM,"With an ocean rich in readily processed organic matter, Samiel is a key source of organics from the Outer Rim. Few people linger here for work, although if that is due to the hard conditions, regular Luddic Path raids, or... something else entirely... is unclear due to censorship by port authorities. Wildly known as the source of the mysterious hallucinogen, the Red Water.",,,
path_soul,CUSTOM,"A bizarre curiosity, Soul is a paradise of a planet that has no right to be so. Its position is too far from Mercy to support such a garden of Eden, and scans of the surface show no terraforming equipment. What is known very well is the violent Luddic Sect that has been on the world since time immemorial. Fanatical to the core, they continually try to cleanse Samiel and the Mercy system of the Unfaithful to 'Let the Sea of Souls lie still'.",,,
mercy_corpse,CUSTOM,"A station of unknown manufacturer, Corpse is a volatile skimming facility. It is clear that this was not the original function of the station, but since the local Luddic Sect repurposed the station its original purpose has been lost.",,,
hmi_mercy_station,CUSTOM,"An abandoned research station, built either to study some interesting local phenomenon or to study top secret sciences which are best kept far, far away from inhabited worlds. Considering the inherent bizarreness of the Mercy system, the presence of this station is unsurprsing. What is surprising is how OLD it is. Indeed, a cursory scan indicates that it has been drifting gradually out of the system for hundreds of cycles.",,,

#Kamikaze,,,,,
hmi_hurricane_station,CUSTOM,"After initial surveys of the outer atmosphere of Hurricane, it was discovered that the gas composition of the outer atmosphere was very similar to precursors of starship fuel. Whether this was a secret terraforming experiment by the Domain or a bizarre natural phenomenon, the result remains the same - the volatiles from Hurricane can be easily and radidly turned into economically viable product. While accessing these stocks directly could be troublesome under the best of times, the combination of neutron radiation, local piracy and strong magnetic fields made viable extraction impossible. However, it was discovered by Hazard Mining that the volatiles could be collected by capturing them when Hurricane is blasted by Kamikaze. To take advantage of this, this station was constructed, creatively named 'Fuyutsuki's Folly' due to the sheer ridiculousness of the location. Nevertheless, the large amount of volatiles produced by the station have quelled naysayers - for the time being.",,,
hmi_typhoon_station,CUSTOM,"Originally a small, independent colony built with the aim of leaving the worries of the Domain behind, this station turned to piracy due to repeated transgressions by Hazard Mining Incorporated. It's isolation is legendary, with those desperate to escape the attention of the Core worlds filling the station habs and finding  work in the dangerous mining operation in the shadow of Kamikaze.",,,
hmi_tornado_station,CUSTOM,"Born out of ingenuity, Port Rascal was originally a small outpost constructed to create a safe haven for the Pirate Dame Sorhyu-Langley to raid the Hazard Mining Company. Since her death, the outpost has steadily grown from refugees and scavengers into a surprisingly stable and somewhat legitimate polity. It even has a Luddic Church embassy, despite being a blatant pirate outpost.",,,

A truly horrific and terrible place.",,,
hmi_mess,CUSTOM,"No one is quite sure where The Mess came from, or how it came to be, but it is widely regarded to be one of the more disturbing objects in the Sector. An orbital habitat overrun by a nanite colony, The Mess has slowly been eating its way through the Opuntia system since before the Fall, spewing out random junk and miss-shapen machinery. The origin of the nanite colony is unknown, and many fear what may occur if another such nanite colony existed, and descended upon the Core Worlds. Occassionally releases swarms of infested ships.",,"On approach your comms is spammed by an insistent transmission. This is not by design - it appears that the transmitter, in order to convey it's message to any vessel that approached, transmits on all frequencies. Not just communication frequencies - ALL frequencies. Including, frustratingly enough, intership communication signals. The signal can be reduced, but the tinny sound continues to squawk through every single communication your make:

""Welcome traveller to Manchester, home of the Domain Resurgent! We are the last remnant of the Domain after the Calamitous Closure of the Gates. On seeing the calamity, the Wise Administrators of Manchester turned their sights to restoring the Domain, sending out Colony Protection Fleets, and setting out to terraform the sector. With the luscious farms of Exeter and the mighty forges of Devon, your every want and desire will be quenched, and soon the Domain will once again bring joy and prosperity to the Sector! Already our expeditions are selecting your future homes, the autonomous drones restructuring the imperfect worlds into lands of milk and honey!

hmi_bauxite,CUSTOM,"Before the company came to the Obsidian there were several small prospecting colonies across the system. After the Company arrived, the survivors had concentrated on Bauxite for protection. Taking on additional survivors of HMI atrocities in the Outer Rim, primarily Luddic colonists, Bauxite has become a crucial center of radical Luddic Resistance against the Company in the area.",,,
hmi_anthracite,CUSTOM,"Once the Company had 'displaced' the original colonists from Anthracite, the ruins were quickly seized by freebooters and mercenaries before the Company could stake their claim. Anthracite has steadily grown as a reaver port, fuelled by the goods illegally siezed from the Company, ore from independant miners in system, and refugees from the Outer Rim.",,,
hmi_galena,CUSTOM,"A scientific marvel, the planet of Galena is covered with a biosphere of complex life based on silicates. The surface of the planet is spotted with tall blocks of breathing crystal, glowing with a complicated array of neural activity.

planet_timms,CUSTOM,"A deeply troubled world, Timms has a harsh jungle ecosystem, supported by an accidental run-away terraforming project that was activated cycles ago. Hazard Mining Incorporated has been dumping unwanted refugees, dissidents and Luddites here for cycles to die. Recently, a regime loyal to the Luddic Church seized control of the surviving population, bringing in support from the Core Systems. Due to direct support from the Church, vigorous conversion programs, and direct intervention by the Knights of Ludd, it looks as though the situation has stablilized somewhat on Timms - something that is deeply troubling to its nemesis, Fuyutsuki.",,,
