HMI_fuel,Enriched Extractor,45,120,,10,,,"mining, industry, industrial",,graphics/icons/industry/planetary_shield.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.HMI_Enriched_Extractor,"Using rather simple processsing techniques, the enriched volatiles from Hurricane are easily harvested en masse from the particles blown off by Kamikaze. The simplistic procedure however, may more charitably be refered to as crude and haphazard, requiring constant input of heavy machinery and crew to function.",9202

HMI_soul,Church of Eva Complex,100,60,,100,,,"structure, militarybase, heavyindustry",,graphics/icons/markets/hmi_soul_church.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.HMI_ChurchofEva,"The Church of Eva considers the technology in this system forbidden according to Luddic Doctrine, but the reason behind it is more complicated. The Church of Eva believes that the remnants of Mercy's high technology aren't man made, instead it is divine machinery come from hevean and perverted by human hands. Consequently the Church has no issue with using said high technology as long as it is in service of cleansing Mercy of outsiders. This includes a small heavy machinery and fuel production operation, but most egregious to standard Luddic Path practice is their use of high-technology ships. The Church of Eva will only openly patrol as long as Soul is in the hands of the Luddic Path and this structure remains intact.",9203

Requires heavy machinery, supplies and crew to function.",9206
