Haunted World,haunted,TRUE,,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.econ.WorldArid,"Widely rumoured to be the site of a failed Tri Tachyon Psi ops experiment, Samiel's oceans are a deep blood red-orange colour due to, ostensibly, a rampant population of microorganisms. The fact that workers readily converting the mass into more suitable organics often have a high accident rate or commit suicide on a disturbingly regular basis is often ignored, as are the whispers often heard coming from the red depths of the ocean.",graphics/icons/markets/hmi_haunted.png,9200
Crystalline World,crystal_world,TRUE,,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.econ.WorldJungle,"A world covered in rich, complex crystalline flora and fauna, the surface of this planet is ripe full of scientific discovery…and rich in materialistic resources.",graphics/icons/markets/hmi_crystalline.png,9201
Distant Polity,distantpolity,TRUE,,data.campaign.econ.DistantPolity,"Many planets in this area face tough challenges when it comes to resupply. The tyrany of distance, piracy and beaurocracy often reduces the ease at which these outer settlements can access Core markets. However, these markets are often used to these disruptions, often functioning for long periods without resupply or indeed any friendly contact.",graphics/icons/markets/outpost.png,9203
Mess Infested,hmi_mess_swarm_cond,TRUE,,data.campaign.econ.MessSwarm,"This planet is currently infected by the Mess. Nanite swarms flow over the landscape, devouring useful elements, before collecting in grey bubbles to be collected by harvester drones, which are in turn collected and sent to the main hive in orbit. The environment is hazardous to everything man-made, and cannot be suppressed by any method known to current understanding of science. Colonising this place would be an effort in futility.",graphics/icons/markets/hmi_nanite.png,9202
Reinforced Construction Facility,hmi_reinforced_condition,,TRUE,data.campaign.econ.industries.HMI_Reinforced_Colony_Cond,"Due to the Reinforced Construction Facility, ongoing colonial maintenance is made safer and more efficient.",graphics/icons/markets/underground_arcology.png,1303
