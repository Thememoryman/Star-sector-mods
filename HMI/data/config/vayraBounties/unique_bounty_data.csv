I'll kill ALL of you backstabbin' bastards, and climb into heaven using a ladder made outta your fuckin' bones!""",FALSE,pirates,200000,10,"The Pirate Lord Captain Kidman is one of the most renowned reavers of the Persean Sector, whose name is still feared on Argeus for his daring theft of an Onslaught from the shipbreaker's yard. The ship was retrofitted and turned into his flagship, and with a large fleet behind him he raided the Sector at large, gaining notoriety and infamy.

That, however, was cycles ago. And since then Kidman has fallen from grace, hounded by Hegemony patrols and rival pirate lords seeking a bounty, accumulated by the survivors of his many atrocities. His fleet, the Brawlin' Maries, is now nothing more than a small handful of ships held together by his prestige, his legend, and his Onslaught mod flagship The Blameless. However, pickings have been getting slimmer and slimmer, and the bounty hunters are closing in. A recent defector has recently released the location of the Brawlin' Maries on the wider Commsec network, and now it's open season on Kidman.

He leans forward, smile bright and soft, ""I don't mind either way, the Family treats everyone with kindness. And when you've passed on from your own foolishness in testing our faith, we'll be sure to show far more hospitality to the survivors of your pride. Anyone can join the Family, and be welcomed amongst our brothers and sisters - if their soul is true and faith strong. Rejoice, sisters and brothers! Your salvation from the Rex Mundi is come!""",FALSE,luddic_church,750000,10,"The Gentle Family is a notorious cult that stalks the outer reachs of the rim, cruelly preying on isolated polities and decivilised colonies to sustain them on their Sacred Exodus. This extremist cult is lead by the charismatic Daniel Gentle, and firmly believes that only the devout followers of Daniel Gentle will be spared the coming fires of an omnipotent and omniscient being the Rex Mundi, that only they can see through his lies, that only they have souls to preserve and be sent to heaven by the Lord's Will. To them, everyone else is a Hollowman, a soulless husk that is used by a puppet of the Rex Mundi. Crimes committed against a Hollowman do not count, as they are not real people - something that members of the Family use as an excuse for truly breathtaking atrocities done by themselves and Daniel Gentle. Some, however, are real people blinded by the Rex Mundi, and their souls can be saved through an extensive process involving torture, coercion  and mind-altering drugs. If, after being tested on their faith and loyalty to Daniel Gentle they prove devout, they too join the Cult. If they do not, then they are treated little worse than slaves, often executed by being thrown out the airlock during a sermon aboard the Good Ship Gentle.

For the most part the Gentle Family stayed too far away from the core systems to even register on the major polity radar, however recently Daniel Gentle has been moving closer and closer to the Core, with the aim of attacking Gilead. There, he will ascend to heaven along with his followers, and the Sector will be purged for their grevious sins. The Luddic Church, not particularly wanting a crazed lunatic at the head of a giant fleet attacking what might be the most sacred site to the Luddic Faith, has posted a bounty for the Family's destruction - a bounty enhanced by survivors of the Gentle Family's cruelties.",hmi_locomotive_lp_variant,,300,1.5,1,,,FALSE,FALSE,209,15,1
