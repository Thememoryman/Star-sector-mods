MagicLensFlare: createSmoothFlare() temporarily deprecated due to changes in 0.95 breaking them.

0.31

Added MagicCampaign:
   . A collection of methods that are handy to create systems and spawn stuff in them.
   . Also includes a method to create custom bounty-type fleets and give them simple orders.

Consolidated a lot of methods with incrementally more detailed declaration variable into fewer ones, 
the old methods are still available to maintain compatibility but are now tagged as deprecated and will be removed in a future update.

0.30

Added MagicSettings:
   . A collections of methods to easily read variables and lists from a shared modSettings.json file.
   . It is intended to create a unified settings system across mods to make inter-mod integration much easier.

   . Now supports sprite flickering and jittering.

MagicTrails:
   . Added "base_trail_contrail" to default available trails.
   . Added compensation attribute to MagicAutoTrails to fix offset following projectiles with fast lateral drift. (courtesy of TomatoPaste)
   . Added a non-verbose implementation of MagicAutoTrails used when not in dev Mode.

MagicVectorThrusters:
   . Probably fixed a long standing rotation error with the vectoring thruster script
   . Added support for vector thruster covers (non animated thrusters will only turn).

MagicInterferencePlugin:
   . Fixed minor error in the Interference hullmod tooltip.
   . Added a non-verbose implementation used when not in dev Mode.

0.29

Added MagicInterferencePlugin
   . Makes exceptionally strong weapons with the "Interference" trait have negative effects when more that one is mounted on a given ship.
   . Those weapons need to trigger the plugin to check for possible other interference sources from a CSV file.
   . If other sources are found, it will add a hullmod that reduced the ship's dissipation depending on the number of interfering weapons and their interference strength.

Added MagicBasicInterferenceEffec loose weapon script to trigger an interference check.

Added MagicIncompatibleHullmods
   . Proposes a uniform "incompatible hullmod" solution.
   . When triggered as two incompatible hullmods are added, it will remove the offending hullmod and add a hullmod to warn the player about that operation.
   . The added hullmod's tooltip will indicate which hullmod was removed and why.

Added MagicModuleRetreatCleaner
   . Fixes the bug with retreating ships with modules preventing the combat from ending. 

MagicRender:
   . Added optional blending modes to the sprite renders.

MagicUI:
   . Fixed crash when used the first frame in combat.
